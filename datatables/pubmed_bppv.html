	<td>Spontaneous, positional, and paroxysmal positional nystagmus were studied before and after sectioning the superior division of the vestibular nerve and the anterior vestibular artery in squirrel monkeys. Histopathologic study of the temporal bones confirmed the degeneration of the macula utriculi with release of statoconia, but failed to identify the released utricular statoconia within the vestibular endolymphatic space in any animal. Postoperatively the animals consistently demonstrated direction-fixed spontaneous nystagmus until the end of the experiment (five months). Positional tests and Dix-Hallpike maneuver occasionally changed the intensity of the spontaneous nystagmus, but never elicited paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Possible reasons for not demonstrating paroxysmal positional nystagmus in the squirrel monkey are as follows: a resorption of statoconia; slight morphological alteration of the sensory epithelia of the posterior cristae; interference of the posterior crista function due to partial collapse of the membranous ampulla; the existence of interspecies difference; or possibly a faulty hypothesis regarding the etiologic mechanism of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Summary--Ru-Vert, a combination product, containing in each tablet, 25 mg of pentylenetetrazol, 12.5 mg of pheniramine maleate, and 50 mg of nictonic acid, was evaluated in the treatment of seventeen patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The study was double-blind with crossover.

	<td>In patients who complain of vertigo or who have equilibrium disorders, it is often difficult to determine the etiology of the disorder, that is to determine whether it is dependent on a peripheral or central vestibular disorder. To attempt to determine the etiology in these cases, we divised a new method, the caloric eye tracking pattern test (CETP-Test). Seventeen normal subjects and 161 patients were tested. The latter group included 33 with peripheral disorders such as Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus, and others, and 128 with central disorders such as vertebral basilar artery insufficiency, cervical vertigo, and others, were tested. The cases of central disorders were limited to those patients whose eye tracking pattern before the caloric stimulation was normal. In normal subjects and in patients with peripheral disorders, it is well known that caloric nystagmus has little influence on the eye tracking pattern. In contrast, in patients with central vestibular disorders, caloric nystagmus evokes abnormalities on the eye tracking pattern, either superimposed or saccades, despite the fact that the eye tracking pattern before the caloric stimulation is normal. First we administer the eye tracking stimulation test using a target which moves horizontally at 0.3 cycle per second. Next, we perform the caloric test on the right ear, using 20 c.c. of ice water for 10 seconds. During the evoked caloric nystagmus we administer the eye tracking test once again. The eye tracking pattern is recorded for 20 seconds beginning 50 seconds after the start of the ice water injection. The procedure repeated on the left ear. The results on each case are presented as three patterns of ENG-recording. We may stat that in normal subjects and in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders, visual suppression of caloric nystagmus remains functional. Caloric induced nystagmus does not affect the CETP. In patients with central vestibular disorders, visual suppression of caloric nystagmus does not function properly because of defects in the visual suppression mechanism. Therefore, caloric nystagmus greatly influences the CETP. Consequently, the CETP may not be smooth when CETP test is administered to patients with central vestibular disorders. We may say also that the visual suppression to the vestibular nystagmus is evoked more strongly by pursuing a moving visual stimulus than by gazing a stational target. These results allow for a differential diagnosis between peripheral and central disorders.</td>

	<td>An evaluation was made on ten patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in whom transection of the posterior ampullary nerve was performed by the middle ear approach under local anesthesia. The undermost ear in the provocative test position was selected for surgery. All ten patients were relieved of positional vertigo by the procedure. Of the five patients who were relieved of BPPV by posterior ampullary nerve transection prior to 1974, the long-term follow-up on four revealed continued relief of vertigo. Five additional patients treated by this surgical procedure since 1975 have also experienced relief from BPPV, but a moderate sensorineural hearing loss occurred in one patient. Two additional patients with BPPV were explored surgically but the singular canal could not be located. Persistence of the vertigo in these two patients strengthens the conclusion that the posterior semicircular canal sense organ is largely responsible for BPPV.</td>

In some instances, paroxysmal positional nystagmus may be found when the abnormal ear (side) is uppermost rather than directed toward the floor; this fact may have important implications if singular neurectomy is to be performed.</td>

	<td>A patient seeking emergency treatment for a labyrinthine disorder is usually complaining of dizziness. The task at hand in the emergency room is, first, to rule out the truly life threatening emergent disorders, and then by means of a rapid but adequate history and physical examination to aid in the differentiation between central and peripheral etiologies. If the problem is central, and especially if there are signs of a true emergency, there should be no hesitation in sharing the responsibility for the care of this patient with a neurologist or neurosurgeon. If one is convinced that the problem is of a peripheral etiology, one most likely is dealing with Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or true labyrinthitis. An acoustic tumor must always be considered. Appropriate laboratory and x-ray studies may be initiated and therapy begun. Although the emergency room evaluation can be inclusive and accurate, it is necessarily incomplete. There is no substitute for a more thorough history and physical examination under more relaxed conditions, complete audiometry, electronystagmography, polytomography, myelography, angiography, or whatever additional sophisticated studies are deemed necessary. If performed well, however, the emergency room encounter forms an invaluable foundation upon which further diagnostic and treatment decisions are based.</td>

Sixty-six of the patients experienced complete relief of the vertigo within three to 14 days; in two patients, the vertigo recurred but responded to a second course of therapy. The one patient whose condition did not respond was found to have a perilymphatic fistula that mimicked BPPV. The presumed mechanism for this therapy is the loosening and ultimate dispersion of degenerated otolithic particles from the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal.</td>

These included vertigo provoked by arising, bending over, head rotation, linear acceleration, and vertical oscillation. Some have not been reported previously in relation to this syndrome. Elimination of both concurrent and classic symptoms via singular neurectomy in nine patients indicates a common pathophysiologic mechanism, probably involving cuplolithiasis in the posterior semicircular canal. These concurrent symptoms should be considered part of the syndrome.</td>

Selection criteria, results, and complications are discussed. The risk of cochlear damage limits singular neurectomy to patients who are severely incapacitated by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Compared with vestibular neurectomy, singular neurectomy avoid risks inherent in intracranial procedures, and the vertigo caused by surgical intervention is less pronounced.</td>

Vestibulospinal screening tests were slightly more sensitive (not statistically significant) than caloric tests for detection of a peripheral vestibular disorder. Caloric, rotation, and vestibulospinal screening tests were specific neither for MD nor BPPN groups. The caloric test false-positive rate for the involved ear was unacceptably high for the BPPN group. The rotation test false-positive rate was the highest of the three tests for both groups. The vestibulospinal test combined with either the caloric or the rotational tests increased the sensitivity for detection of a peripheral vestibular disturbance, particularly for the MD patients.</td>

	<td>The results of a poll revealed that 96 singular neurectomies have been performed by ten surgeons in this country. Eighty-eight of these (91.7%) resulted in complete relief of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In seven patients (7.3%) there was a sensorineural hearing loss as a result of this procedure. The average hospital stay for patients having this procedure ranged from 2-6 days, and the return to work time ranged from 1 to 3 weeks. These results indicate that singular neurectomy is an effective selective vestibular ablation procedure for BPPV and that the risks and disability are comparable to other routine middle ear procedures. The causes for failure of this procedure to relieve positional vertigo are a) misdiagnosis of BPPV and b) failure to recognize the singular nerve in the middle ear. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disorder and of the anatomical variation in the location of the singular canal will reduce these causes of failure.</td>

	<td>Although vertigo is commonly encountered in many clinical disciplines, meticulous analysis of the onset and nature of the vertigo is essential not to overlook the vertigo of brainstem or cerebral origin without any other neurological signs and symptoms. Three central vestibular projection pathways and their possible functional roles in relation to vertigo were briefly discussed. To illustrate the characteristic clinical features of vertigo of various origins, 16 typical cases were presented and discussed. Their etiology include Ménière's disease, vertigo of neurovascular compression, sudden deafness, acoustic neurinoma, Rumsay-Hunt's syndrome, BPPN (benign paroxysmal positioning nystagmus), vestibular neuronitis, brainstem infarct, MPPN (malignant persistent positional nystagmus) with brainstem midline hemorrhage, cerebellar hemorrhage followed by orthostatic hypotension, vertiginous epilepsy, TIA from MCA stenosis, intracerebral hemorrhage from a mycotic aneurysm, falx meningioma, subclavian steal phenomenon, and cervical spondylosis. It is wrong and quite dangerous to believe that vertigo of CNS origin should be associated with some definite neurological signs and symptoms and to diagnose the vertigo to be of peripheral origin merely based on normal findings of CT scan and angiography. Recently advanced detailed neurootological investigations are quite helpful in differentiating vertigo of various origins, but may totally overlook the vertigo of serious CNS pathology. For "solo vertigo," the key point is first differentiate BPPN and vertibular neuronitis from others after which careful neurosurgical and neurootological evaluation should be pursued regardless of presence or absence of concomitant neurological findings.</td>

	<td>Abnormal vestibular function disrupts postural and ocular muscle control system references to gravity (earth) vertical. Vestibular disorders also prevent satisfactory resolution of normally redundant, but often conflicting, visual and somatosensory spatial references required for normal postural control during active and passive body motion. Using a moving platform and visual surrounds posturography technique to systematically interact visual, somatosensory, and vestibular inputs, it was clearly demonstrated that patients with the benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus type of distorted vestibular function employ an unstable, visually dependent postural sway distinct from the postural instability associated with unilateral or bilateral vestibular functional deficits. These findings have important clinical implications for diagnosis and management of patients with vestibular disorders.</td>

	<td>Abnormal vestibular function disrupts a subject's reference to gravity (earth) vertical, and prevents resolution of conflicting or inaccurate visual and somatosensory spatial references. However, errors which patients make when attempting to resolve conflicting visual and somatosensory orientation inputs during upright stance differed markedly in patients with (1) symmetric or asymmetric reduced vestibular function, (2) benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus and vertigo, and (3) a combination of distorted and reduced function. Objective characterization of spatial orientation systems and compensatory strategies under altered sensory conditions is an essential first step toward identifying optimal treatment methods for each of these three types of vestibular deficient patients.</td>

	<td>We have identified a group of patients with vestibular disorders whose symptoms are not consistent with the commonly recognized syndromes such as Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and vestibular neuronitis. These patients have a constant positional vertigo and are often nauseated to an extent that makes them disabled. Their symptoms do not respond to conventional medical treatment or habituating therapy. We have found specific clinical-pathological signs in these patients that indicate that the vestibular nerve is compressed intracranially by blood vessels. Treatment of nine such patients by microvascular decompression of the eighth nerve brought total relief of symptoms in eight patients and improvement in one. We suggest that this syndrome be named disabling positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>In order to investigate interaction of the vestibular and optokinetic systems in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders, the visual vestibulo-ocular reflex (V-VOR) gain in 49 patients with peripheral vestibular disorders was quantitatively measured by using pendular harmonic sinusoidal rotation with optokinetic stationary stimuli. The patients were rotated sinusoidally both with eyes closed and open at an amplitude of 240 degrees and at a frequency of 0.1 Hz (peak velocity 75.4%s). Comparing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and V-VOR gains in the patients with definite Meniere's disease (23 cases), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV, 13 cases) and sudden deafness with vertigo or dizziness (13 cases), the VOR-DP and normal V-VOR gain were more frequently observed in patients with Meniere's disease (13 cases) and sudden deafness (7 cases) than in those with the BPPV (3 cases). In the four patients with bilateral Meniere's disease and sudden deafness, abnormally decreased VOR-gain (under 0.55) in the bilateral directions with slightly decreased V-VOR gain was measured when tested independently. However, abnormal V-VOR gain was observed in only one case of sudden deafness due to retrocochlear lesions. From our VOR and V-VOR gain observations comparing the caloric responses, we have concluded that the comparison of VOR with V-VOR gains provides additional information for evaluation of peripheral vestibular disorders as well as central nervous system disorders.</td>

	<td>It is well known that paroxysmal positional vertigo is induced by change of head position and subsides immediately when the head is returned to the original position. There are two types of paroxysmal positional vertigo. One is what DIX and HALLPIKE (1952) call the benign type which is thought to be caused by otolith lesions. Another is a malignant type, in contrast to the former and is related to a lesion in the central nervous system. Otologists are usually familiar with the former, but the latter is not known among neurologists and neurosurgeons. We experienced 37 cases of the malignant type and found that this type of paroxysmal vertigo is induced by various diseases. Furthermore, we believe that the mechanism of this paroxysmal vertigo is the lack of inhibitory function of the vestibular cerebellum, and not abrupt malfunction of communication of the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system. We also believe that this symptom is a very useful sign for diagnosing lesions of the cerebellar vermis.</td>

The complete immediate relief of the positional vertigo and nystagmus that resulted from 39 of 40 singular neurectomies establishes this procedure as an effective management for patients with the chronic disabling form of cupulolithiasis. The ocular response in cupulolithiasis and the release nystagmus that follows singular neurectomy are explained by neural pathways that have been previously elucidated by anatomic and physiologic techniques. Although sensorineural hearing loss followed surgery three times among the first 15 patients, hearing loss has not occurred in the last 25 operations for cupulolithiasis.</td>

	<td>The site of origin of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the posterior semicircular canal and when persistent, the condition is known as cupulolithiasis. Singular neurectomy is the current procedure of choice for the treatment of incapacitating cupulolithiasis. The neurectomy is difficult to learn and carries a significant risk of hearing loss. An alternative procedure, whereby the posterior canal is occluded, is discussed. This was performed on 11 guinea pigs and the effect on hearing was measured using brainstem evoked audiometry. Eight animals showed no hearing loss while the other three had a mild to moderate loss of hearing due to intra-operative complications. The effect of canal plugging on hearing compares favorably with the hearing results obtained with singular neurectomy. Posterior semicircular canal occlusion is suggested as a safer and technically easier treatment for incapacitating cupulolithiasis.</td>

	<td>Cervicogenic vertigo can be elicited by hyperactivity of spinovestibular afferents and, much more seldomly, by episodic reduction of blood flow in the vertebral artery. The afferent hyperactivity to the vestibular system derives from a "circulus vitiosus" involving false posture, pain, joint dysfunction, which in turn exacerbates the false posture - and so on. This is to be observed in the joints CO/C1 and C1/C2 and their short muscles. This dysfunction of the upper cervical spine can be determined by exact anamnesis, careful investigation of neck mobility, joint play and muscle tension. The cervical nystagmus observed during the neck torsion test is short (seconds) in functional diseases (hyperactivity) and longlasting (minutes) in cases of vascular disorder. Cervical vertigo should be differentiated from other atactic disorders, especially those arising from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and from Menière's disease.</td>

	<td>Peripheral paroxysmal, benign positional vertigo is one of the most common peripheral vestibular disorders. According to the "cupulolithiasis hypothesis", it is assumed that inorganic material is attached to the cupula of the posterior vertical canal which renders this organ sensitive to gravitational forces rather than angular accelerations. Quantitative and well-controlled positioning manoeuvres, however, show that the characteristics of this kind of vertigo and the corresponding nystagmus cannot be explained by gravitation-dependent cupular reactions. It seems more probable that the typical symptoms are caused by disturbed utricular functions leading to disinhibited responses of the posterior vertical canal to adequate stimuli.</td>

Comparing the data between NS and BPPV at the compensated stage, the latter group was unstable while watching LED with OKN on the tactile information plate (S-G plate). The significant differences were for RMS and SD-Area. The data of the NS and the untreated VDS show that the latter group was more unstable while watching LED with OKN than in the dark on the S-G plate.

	<td>After stapedectomy otoliths were displaced from the endolymphatic space to the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal and caused a paroxysmal benign positional nystagmus which lasted 18 months. The positional nystagmus demonstrated a rotatory component during the Hallpike manoeuvre. The paroxysmal benign nystagmus disappeared after transtympanic nerve neurectomy of the inferior branch of the vestibular nerve (Gacek 1974). This procedure is only recommended for vertigo lasting longer than 1 year. The current findings support the theory that cupulolithiasis is the cause of paroxysmal benign positional nystagmus which can occur after stapedectomy. The rotatory nystagmus is generated in the posterior semicircular canal.</td>

	<td>In the last few years, we have studied ocular reflexes caused by tilting stimulations in test subjects placed in an upright sitting position on a chair apparatus which tilts continuously. In healthy persons, a weak nystagmus can be observed, and involves a nystagmus of minor amplitude and showing a small number of beats. The actual incidence of nystagmus in the younger group was minimal, but it tended to increase with age. This occurrence is considered to be due to age-related degeneration of the otolithic organ. Patients with vertigo and/or dizziness clearly develop nystagmus. These responses are classified as follows: type I is of fixed direction; type II is of changed direction; and type III is a combination of the first and second types. Among the peripheral vestibular disorders, particularly involving those patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, a nystagmus of changed direction was found. This type was rarely seen in patients with other vestibular disorders, but was a common occurrence in healthy individuals who readily experienced motion sickness. These observations have led us to conclude that patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo have definite reactions which are similar to those of individuals with motion sickness, and that such depends on the susceptibility of the otolithic organs.</td>

	<td>Conventional vestibular rotation testing with the head centered on the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0.1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with head centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with head eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with head eccentric in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with head eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus with respect to the gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses with head eccentric. We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function.</td>

The origin of the disturbance is peripheral and the data observed in the cases treated confirm that it is not located in horizontal canal function. However, canal dysfunction can be present together with ppv. Usually a separate course is observed for the phenomena attributed to horizontal dysfunction and those to the ppv lesion. The specificity of the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvres linked to the typical ppv is also confirmed by the data obtained by testing for VHT (VHT-test-battery). Ppv can have a repercussion upon the vestibulospinal reflex. That the same ppv disturbance can coincide with normal as well as with abnormal posturographic data, pleads for the intervention of central adaptive mechanisms. The effect of VHT is due to stimulation of these central adaptive mechanisms and not to any impact upon the peripheral lesion.</td>

A series of patients with such typical "unilateral" cases were treated by the brisk method and were compared with a second series of identical cases treated by the VHT technique. The results after 1 week seemed to be different: with the brisk method 52% of the patients were free of vertigo, while only 32% with VHT were vertigo free. This difference is not statistically significant. However, those cases treated by VHT and still having vertigo after 1 week had a striking reduction in the severity of their vertigo, as estimated by the score-system used. In contrast, the scores were unchanged for those cases not responding to the brisk method. Continuation of treatment of these latter cases using VHT exercises showed that the final result after 6 weeks was equal for both groups.</td>

In three of the seven cases, the condition occurred when the patients first arose from bed after 5 to 6 days of postoperative bedrest. In two cases, BPPV occurred when patients moved their head while maintaining strict bedrest. In the other two cases, it occurred 1 to 4 days after patients had been released from bedrest. The cause of BPPV was considered to be postoperative bedrest which might have facilitated the deposition of precipitate on the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal. The prognosis was good, and all the patients recovered within 20 days.</td>

	<td>In 1980, the Research Committee of Peripheral Vestibular Disorders in Japan, which is supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, was founded by 24 members, from several districts in Japan. The Committee's first task was to draft the diagnostic criteria for several peripheral vestibular disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and vestibular neuronitis. For the national epidemiological survey, they then collected the data on 101 cases of BPPV out of some 783 vestibular disorder patients. In addition, data on 103 patients of BPPV out of 559 vestibular disorder patients were also collected from the Neuro-otological Clinic of the Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital. From these epidemiological surveys, the incidence of BPPV in Japan was estimated at 10.7 per 100,000 population, while that of BPPV in Toyama was estimated at 17.3 per 100,000 population. The ratio of BPPV was higher in female than male patients in both surveys. The age at the onset of BPPV peaked in the fourth decade in both males and females. Compared with the other epidemiological features of Meniere's disease and sudden deafness with vertigo in the same surveys, it appeared that the characteristic features of BPPV are epidemiologically similar to those of Meniere's disease, but different from those of sudden deafness.</td>

In this paper, two cases of pediatric vestibular neuronitis will be reported in detail. All six patients with vestibular neuronitis were boys, and the affected sides were equally distributed in the group. The patients recovered within two to four weeks, a prognosis which is better than that observed in adults. With regard to directional nystagmus, the gaze was bilateral in five patients and vertical in two. They showed neuro-otologic findings that suggest not only unilateral dysfunction but also bilateral disorders or partial lesions on the central vestibular system. Consequently, in the hope that the study of vertigo in childhood may provide additional clues to the pathogenesis of the disease in adults, we would like to consider two cases of pediatric cases of vestibular neuronitis.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is quite frequently found as an otological consequence of cranial traumas; thus leading to medico-legal implications. An attempt has herewith been made to evaluate these implications on the basis of data available. Therefore, 158 patients suffering from BPPV were examined between 1984-1986. Of these 23% of the total were post-traumatic forms (of medico-legal interest). Among patients suffering from post-traumatic vestibular disturbances in the broad sense, the incidence of BPPV proved to be greater in the ages ranging from 50 to 70. In those under 30 years of age BPPV was hardly ever present (5% of the total) although when it was its origin was always post-traumatic. The temporal evolution of paroxysmal positional vertigo, which tends to spontaneously disappear, is paralleled in BPPV patients whether it is of post-traumatic origin or not. On the other hand, the subjective sensation of positional vertigo takes longer to clear up in post-traumatic BPPV patients, most likely due to factors stemming from the so-called "compensation syndrome". Any medico-legal evaluation of BPPV must, therefore, take into account its natural favorable evolution. This makes it necessary to examine the patient several times over a period of at least six months from the moment of trauma. In medico-legal terms, the features of BPPV (i.e. position setting it off, duration of vertigo, frequency with which it appears when that position is assumed, presence and duration of the positional nystagmus) lead to inability to work in from 2 to 10% of the cases.</td>

	<td>Two treatments for the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are presented and evaluated in this article. The first type of treatment is the surgical section of the posterior ampullary nerve according to Gacek and the second is physiotherapeutic by the manoeuvre of Semont. The section of the posterior ampullary nerve has been realised between 1980 and 1986 on 5 patients suffering from persistent and disabling positional vertigo. All 5 patients were relieved from their vertigo immediately after the operation. One patient developed a post-operative hearing loss. The physiotherapeutic manoeuvre of Semont, which has been developed in order to liberate otolithic deposits from the cupula of the posterior semi-circular canal is applied in our clinic since 1985 as treatment of the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The efficiency of the manoeuvre was tested at first in a retrospective study on 50 patients. A single manoeuvre cured 20 of these patients and 15 others were cured after a second manoeuvre. Then, a controlled and prospective study was performed: the clinical course of 40 patients without treatment was compared with 37 patients treated with Semont's manoeuvre. In the group of patients without treatment, only 17 were spontaneously cured from their positional vertigo after 18 days of evolution. In the group treated by Semont's manoeuvre 19 patients were completely healed from vertigo and 16 others were greatly improved. On the basis of these favourable results the authors recommend to treat all cases of paroxysmal positional vertigo at first with Semont's manoeuvre. The section of the posterior ampullary nerve should be restricted to the rare cases with persistent and disabling vertigo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>

	<td>Over a period of 4 years we observed 15 cases of benign positional vertigo (BPV) probably caused by deposition of otoliths in the horizontal semicircular canal. Rapid rolling onto one side in recumbent position provokes a paroxysmal, purely horizontal and geotropic nystagmus which nearly always spontaneously inverts direction. Rolling the patient onto the other side provokes a left intense geotropic nystagmus. BPV is more violent but resolves more rapidly than that of the better known posterior canal positional vertigo. Sometimes both syndromes are present together.</td>

	<td>Main features of the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (B.P.P.V.) are: latency before the onset of vertigo, nystagmus of the rotatory type beating toward the lower ear, nystagmus tires out, nystagmus gets inverted when the head is brought back to orthostatism, nystagmus is reproducible as many times as the position is taken. B.P.P.V. is due to a deposit of heavy material on the cupula of the posterior semi circular canal. In this unusual condition, the cupula moves under the effect of gravity acceleration. The goal of the treatment is to free the cupula. The manoeuvre consists after determination of the position that elicits the vertigo to move the whole head and body together of the patient to a 180 degree opposite position in which the addition to the endolymph flow forces and weight forces of the material will unstick it from the cupula. The positive result of the manoeuvre is instantly proved by the arising of a rotatory nystagmus beating again toward the sick ear. In other words it is not the inversion of the primary nystagmus but a nystagmus beating the same direction. This is explained by the dynamic of the cupula: in the prime position the density modified cupula moves toward the canal. At the end of the manoeuvre when the velocity of the head is zero, the cupula has to support different forces. First the addition of the endolymph flow forces and the inertia of the heavy material makes the cupula move toward the ampulla. Secondly when the superficial tension forces are too high the heavy material unstick from the cupula and it goes back to its normal position. En this very moment the cupula moves toward the canal. The results are of more than 90% positive in one ore two sessions 4,2% of recurrence. The manoeuvre is unsuccessful in spontaneous nystagmus revealed by a position, in torsional nystagmus as in fistulas or in central position nystagmus.</td>

Soon after unilateral labyrinthectomy, the OCR to the ipsilateral side was reduced or was 0, whereas OCR to the contralateral side was normal or slightly reduced.

The purpose of this study was to make a quantitative evaluation of the body stability in both normal and ataxic patients who were standing erect. The technique utilised was pattern-recognition, composed of principal component analysis and discriminant analysis. Stabilometrical examinations were carried out in 20 normal subjects, 39 with peripheral vestibular disturbance and 11 with disturbance of the central origin. Each examinee was ordered to keep an upright posture for 60 seconds both with the eyes open and with the eyes closed. The following parameters were used: the area of the ellipse for rejection by a statokinesigram, the maximum width and the total length of body excursion, the root mean square, the velocity, the acceleration and the average frequency in the horizontal plane. These were the same parameters that were used in the first report. Each component predicting a specific character in stabilometry was identified by this study of principal component analysis. The relationship between the components in order and its prediction were as follows: the first component predicted the size of the body movement, the second the force, the third the density, the fourth the difference between body movement with the eyes open and with the eyes closed and the fifth the direction of body sway. Furthermore, the principal components were successfully utilized to allow the classification of the test subjects into three groups: those who were normal, those with peripheral vestibular disturbance and those with disturbance of the central origin. Discriminant functions were also used to classify the above mentioned three groups and another five groups, namely: those who were normal, those with vestibular neuronitis, those with positional vertigo of the benign paroxysmal type, those with Ménière's disease and those with cerebellar ataxia. In classification of the three groups, the significant parameters used for discrimination were as follows (P less than 0.05): the root mean square with the eyes open, the distance and the maximum width of body excursion in the Y direction with the eyes open, the area of the ellipse for rejection both with the eyes open and with the eyes closed, the maximum width and the average frequency in the X direction with the eyes closed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>

	<td>95 (1): 3-28</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>Positional and positioning vertigo and nystagmus syndromes can be attributed to either peripheral or central vestibular dysfunction. The most common form is benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo which is caused by cupulolithiasis into the posterior semicircular canal. Other labyrinthine manifestations such as positional alcohol nystagmus, positional nystagmus with macroglobulinaemia and "heavy water" or glycerol ingestion occur because of a specific gravity differential between the cupula and the endolymph (buoyancy mechanism). Neurovascular compression of the vestibular nerve may be a causative factor for "disabling positional vertigo" which is an insufficiently described entity. Hesitation is highly justifiable since retromastoid craniectomy for microvascular decompression is the recommended management. Central positional vertigo is either induced by head movements which result in a transient ischaemia of the ponto-medullary brainstem, or by a change in head position relative to the gravitational vector. The latter is comprised of at least three forms: positional downbeat nystagmus (nodulus), positional nystagmus without concurrent vertigo, and positional vertigo with nystagmus. The site of the lesion is always near the fourth ventricle and the vestibular nuclei. The most probable explanation for the positional response is a vestibular tone imbalance caused by disinhibition of the vestibular reflexes on perception, eye, head and body position.</td>

It is characterized by a peripheral balance impairment which occurs during specific movements or positions of the head. The etiology of BPPV is not clear although recent studies by Harada have given more weight to the otolithic theory. The present author has found frequent otoconia attached to the dark cell area around the crista of the semicircular canals. The treatment of BPPV is based on functional re-education of the patient (Semont maneuvers, the Brandt Daroff technique, Norre's V.H.T). The present study involves 62 patients affected by BPPV. The Hallpike maneuver was employed to define the affected side and then the modified Semont maneuver was performed. Recovery was obtained in all patients. The cure rate proved to be 82% after the first examination. The modified Semont maneuver is easier to perform than the traditional maneuver and has given excellent therapeutic results.</td>

Significant and additive effects of sex and motion sickness susceptibility were demonstrated. Females susceptible to motion sickness proved highly inaccurate when attempting to set a line to the vertical with rotation of the background, while males resistant to motion sickness were the most accurate at this task. Two possible explanations are discussed, the first suggesting subclinical intersubject differences in otolithic sensitivity, and the second postulating deficiencies in intersensory integration. Parallels are drawn with the patterns of multisensory coordination for postural orientation seen in children and in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

The application of this technique to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is described in the first two patients to undergo this procedure. The partitioning technique involves blue-lining the posterior semicircular canal near its ampulla and lasing the blue-lined area. The technique provides a prompt decrease and the ultimate elimination of BPPV. There is some mild motion sensitivity of 6 to 8 weeks duration, and some transient (3-week) sensorineural hearing loss. The use of immediate postoperative low dose steroids provides marked decrease in the motion sensitivity and elimination of the transient sensorineural hearing loss. Lasing two adjacent areas on the posterior semicircular canal may prevent transient recurrence of the positional vertigo during the healing process.</td>

	<td>This is a review of selected aspects of the history of the vestibular system (J. E. Purkyne, E. Mach, A. Crum-Brown) and of our current understanding of vestibular malfunction in clinical vertigo syndromes. Evidence is presented for a preliminary classification of central vestibular brainstem syndromes according to the three major planes of action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR): (1) disorders of the VOR in the horizontal (yaw) plane (horizontal nystagmus, pseudo 'vestibular neuritis'); (2) disorders of the VOR in the sagittal (pitch) plane (downbeat nystagmus; upbeat nystagmus); (3) disorders of the VOR in the frontal (roll) plane (ocular tilt reaction; lateropulsion). The pathophysiology of peripheral vestibular disorders is discussed: a specific gravity differential between the cupula fluid and the endolymph (buoyancy mechanism) causes vertigo in benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo and positional alcohol nystagmus. Vestibular neuritis is probably a partial unilateral vestibular paralysis due to viral infection of the superior division of the nerve trunk. The common post-traumatic vertigo is explained by otolith dysfunction secondary to dislodged otoconia resulting in unequal loads on the macula beds and a tonus imbalance between the two otoliths.</td>

The most common lesions of the central nervous system that cause dizziness are infratentorial ischaemia, mechanical trauma, multiple sclerosis and cerebellar atrophy. Other aetiological factors include intoxications, psychogenic causes, cervical problems and cardiovascular diseases. The history and physical examination are the cornerstones of the search for the cause of dizziness. The most valuable otological methods are electronystagmography and audiometry.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common condition which is usually self-limiting. Surgical treatment is rarely required and for many years the mainstay of such treatment has been singular neurectomy (posterior ampullary nerve section). A new operation has recently been described for the treatment of BPPV involving occlusion of the posterior semicircular canal. We have performed this operation on five patients with intractable BPPV and report our results with follow up of between 12 and 36 months from operation. The excellent results of posterior semicircular canal occlusion which have been previously reported in the literature are confirmed by our experience. In our opinion the operation is a safe and effective alternative to singular neurectomy.</td>

	<td>This report outlines our experience with posterior semicircular canal occlusion, a new operative procedure for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We postulate that the resulting solid canal "plug" prevents endolymph movement within the posterior canal, which effectively fixes the cupula. This selectively abolishes the receptivity of the posterior canal to both angular acceleration and gravity without influencing the other inner ear receptors. We previously reported the success of this procedure in two patients with BPPV and a co-existing profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. Since that report, a slightly modified technique has been used to occlude six more posterior canals--five in normal hearing ears. While our follow-up times range from only 3 to 18 months, all eight patients continue to be relieved of their BPPV. Temporary mixed hearing losses occurred in three of the five ears with normal preoperative hearing. Hearing in all five patients ultimately returned to the preoperative state. We believe this procedure is a simpler and safer alternative to singular neurectomy for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Positioning nystagmus accompanied by severe vertigo has been reported in patients with partial lesions of the inner ear, especially otolith lesions. Typically, this type of nystagmus shows a latent period and subsequent fatiguability. We concur with this finding and have constantly emphasized the significance of this phenomenon in clinical diagnosis. Since we started using CT-scanning, this type of nystagmus has been noted in 47 patients, all of whom had cerebellar vermis lesions. Attention should be focused on this association; if such a combination were seen in only 1 or 2 patients, it could simply be attributed to coincidence. But its occurrence in as many as 47 patients indicates a causal role of cerebellar vermis lesions. Its mechanism may be explained by incomplete inhibition of the vestibulo-oculomotor system including the cerebellar flocculonodular lobe or vestibulo-cerebellum.</td>

	<td>We have studied ocular reflexes caused by tilting stimulations in test subjects placed in an upright sitting position on a chair apparatus which tilts continuously. In healthy persons, a weak nystagmus can be observed of minor amplitude and showing a small number of beats. The actual incidence of nystagmus in the younger group was minimal, but it tended to increase with age. This occurrence is considered to be due to age-related degeneration of the otolithic organ. Patients with vertigo and/or dizziness clearly develop nystagmus. These responses are classified as follows: type I is of fixed direction: type II is of changed direction; and type III is a combination of the first and second types. Among the peripheral vestibular disorders, particularly involving patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, a nystagmus of changed direction was found. This type was rarely seen in patients with other vestibular disorders, but was a common occurrence in healthy individuals who readily experienced motion sickness. These observations have led us to conclude that patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo have definite reactions which are similar to those of individuals with motion sickness, and that this depends on the susceptibility of the otolithic organs.</td>

This article describes the procedure and its rationale, and reports the results in 30 patients who exhibited the classic nystagmus of BPPV with Hallpike maneuvers. CRP obtained timely resolution of the nystagmus and positional vertigo in 100%. Of these, 10% continued to have atypical symptoms, suggesting concomitant pathology; 30% experienced one or more recurrences, but responded well to retreatment with CRP. These results also support an alternative theory that the densities that impart gravity-sensitivity to a semicircular canal in BPPV are free in the canal, rather than attached to the cupula. CRP offers significant advantages over invasive and other noninvasive treatment modalities in current use.</td>

	<td>A posturographic six-test set was developed in order to investigate the contribution of each sensory input in the balance performance of patients with peripheral vestibular disturbances. In test 1 (t1) the three sensory inputs are contributing to balance. In (t2), the contribution of vision is excluded by closing the eyes; in (t3) the neck proprioceptor is influenced by extreme retroflexion of the head, and in (t4) the input of the foot-ankle proprioceptor is altered by standing on foam rubber. The first two conditions are combined with the third one in (t5-t6). This test procedure compares the results obtained when the input of one (or two) sensors is impeded or altered with the results when the same sensors are uninfluenced. This comparison allows us to evaluate the individual contribution of the sensory inputs involved in the process of balance, especially in the compensation process in patients with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) and with Ménière's disease. This comparative evaluation shows several "formulae." So can formulae with positive tests for head in retroflexion condition be more frequently met in the BPPV-group, whereas influence of visual exclusion is more frequently seen in the Ménière group.</td>

	<td>Most clinicians accept cupulolithiasis as the pathophysiological mechanism underlying benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV.) According to this theory, a cupular deposit induces a gravitational effect on the posterior canal crista. Posterior semicircular canal occlusion is a new operative procedure for treating incapacitating BPPV. It is postulated that canal occlusion abolishes endolymph movement within the canal, effectively fixing the cupula and rendering it unresponsive to both angular and linear acceleration (gravity). During two recent canal occlusions, abundant "free-floating particles" were identified within the posterior canal endolymph. When changing the position of the canal in the earth vertical plane, these free-floating particles would move under the influence of gravity. The hydrodynamic drag of the particles would induce endolymph movement with cupular displacement leading to the typical response. This finding supports an alternate explanation to cupulolithiasis as the pathophysiological mechanism underlying BPPV.</td>

	<td>The incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been documented at 17 percent of all vertiginous patients. Partitioning of the labyrinth is a laser technique for resolution of BPPV. In 1991 Anthony partitioned the posterior semicircular canal of two patients and eliminated their BPPV in 24 hours, which was much sooner than anticipated. This paper presents an animal study that was undertaken to determine why laser partitioning of the posterior semicircular canal resolved BPPV so promptly. The histologic changes 24 hours post-partitioning in the guinea pig showed bony semicircular canal fistula creation, and constriction of the membranous semicircular canal. The constriction caused decreased endolymphatic flow and led to BPPV-resolving long-term obstruction of the membranous canal described by Wilpizeski. Also, the clinical study of the application of partitioning to 14 patients with BPPV is described. The technique under investigation provided the resolution of positional vertigo within 7 days in most cases, and within 8 weeks in all uncomplicated cases. Results included some temporary postoperative motion sensitivity for 6-8 weeks, a transient sensorineural hearing loss in 6 of 14 (43%) patients, and a permanent hearing loss in one (7%) insulin-dependent diabetic patient. Location of the partition on the posterior semicircular canal did not affect the resolution of BPPV, the incidence of transient hearing loss, or the motion sensitivity. Partitioning provided prompt, permanent resolution of BPPV and did not put the hearing at risk in nondiabetic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>

	<td>Theoretical evidence is presented that all the typical features of BPPV (benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo) cannot be explained by cupulolithiasis in that otoconial debris become settled on the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal. A free floating clot of inorganic particles (heavier than endolymph) in the ampullofugal branch of the posterior semicircular canal is more likely to cause the syndrome. The clot always gravitates to the most dependent part of the canal as soon as the patient's head is moved in a way that alters the angle between the canal's plane and the gravity vector. As compared to a plunger (depending on the direction it moves) the clot produces push or pull forces on the cupula, thereby eliciting the BPPV attack. This clot-induced endolymph flow mechanism is compatible with all features of BPPV such as latency, limited duration, fatigability, change in direction of the induced nystagmus, and the efficacy of physical therapy in both posterior and horizontal semicircular canal BPPV. The floating clot is only activated by changes in position of the head relative to the gravitational vector (positioning vertigo) but not by prolonged static positions of the head (positional vertigo), which fits clinical experience. Therefore, canalolithiasis rather than cupulolithiasis provides a better definition of the underlying mechanism in BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or cupulolithiasis is one of the more common peripheral vestibular disorders. Diagnosis is made on the observation of typical positioning nystagmus brought about by the Hallpike manoeuver. In most cases of BPPV, etiology is unknown. Microcirculatory disorders have often been considered responsible for idiopathic BPPV. Few reports have been published on this specific aspect of the problem. In our study we evaluated vertebro-basilar haemodynamics and vasomotory reactivity after Acetazolamide administration in 12 patients with idiopathic BPPV. The results obtained reveal the absence of macrocirculatory impairment in the vertebro-basilar district in basal conditions, but significative vasoreactivity variation after acetazolamide, both in vertebral and basilar arteries. Poor vasomotor reactivity in one vertebral artery was observed in 5 patients and, in two cases, in the basilar artery. Altered vasoreactivity in the middle cerebral arteries was not observed in any case. In the light of these findings, we suggest that a possible inadequate response if microcirculation in the labyrinth, in some particular haemodynamic situations, might cause otolithic damage.</td>

	<td>We observed 9 cases of BPPV developed after vestibular neuronitis. The interval between the onset of BPPV and vestibular neuronitis ranged from 2 weeks to 20 years. All cases were examined for critical head position which provoked vertigo, non-gaze nystagmus, positional and positioning nystagmus and caloric nystagmus. No characteristic signs and symptoms could be observed. The function of the posterior canal is thought to be necessary to provoke positional vertigo. Thus in BPPV after vestibular neuronitis the function of the posterior canal would presumably have been preserved to some degree. The first possibility is that the function of the posterior canal was not impaired in spite of the damage of the lateral canal. The fact that each canal differs in involvement in vestibular neuronitis may be explained by the difference in the blood supply or the innervation between lateral and posterior canals. If only the artery or nerve which is related to the lateral canal is damaged and the artery or nerve to the posterior canal is not involved, then the function of the posterior canal is preserved. So BPPV may occur soon after the disappearance of severe vertigo. The second possibility is that if the posterior canal had been damaged together with the lateral canal and the functions are recovering, BPPV may occur some time after the onset of vestibular neuronitis. The locus of vestibular neuronitis is in the peripheral vestibular system and the extent and degree of the lesion vary, which may explain why there can be time difference of the recovery between the two canals.</td>

Patients were reevaluated 1 to 2 weeks after the treatment and again 4 to 6 months later. Treatment outcome was classified as either asymptomatic, more than 70% improved as rated by the patient, or no change. The treatment designed for cupulolithaisis resulted in remission of vertigo and nystagmus in 70% of the patients and in improvement of the symptoms in another 20%.

	<td>BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) is a very common peripheral vestibular disturbance. The dysfunction becomes manifest mainly by vertigo and typical nystagmus. However, the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) can also be disturbed. This can be shown by the SPGIII (static posturography type III), which is a platform technique evaluating 'sensory interaction' in a way comparable to that of the Equi-test. Half the patients with BPPV show disturbed posturographic results. By interfering with the sensory input of vision and/or proprioception, the separate contribution of each input can be evaluated. Different 'formulae' are seen, from complete normal results, through 'overall' formulae, i.e. an undifferentiated influence in all test-conditions, to specific formulae, where we find 'eye-closure' and 'head retroflexed'-effect and so-called 'vestibular formulae'. These formulae are an expression of the different degrees of compensation achieved by the centres and especially of the 'substituting' compensation by vision and proprioception. These results confirm that posturography does not provide a typical results-pattern, thus the type of peripheral vestibular disorder cannot be diagnosed by it alone. The results give functional information on how the standing position is achieved in these patients with a disturbed VSR-input. The several formulae prove that indeed different compensatory patterns are possible, as has been shown by experiments on vestibular compensation.</td>

	<td>Mostly techniques measuring the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) have been used for the evaluation of patients with dizziness problems. Some investigators, however, have also tried to take into account the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR). So recording techniques for the Romberg-test have been proposed and called posturography (PG). By interfering with the visual and proprioceptive sensory inputs during this PG-testing one tries to find out how 'sensory interaction' is organized in the balance performance of the patient examined. To interfere with vision, closure of the eyes has been commonly used and to interfere with proprioception, the patient can be put on foam-rubber, which makes the contribution of the foot-ankle proprioception less adequate. These interferences are applied once separately and once combined. The degree of 'abnormality' is assessed by a score-system for parameters surface (S) and velocity (V), which measure the postural sway. A comparison of tests with and without influence on the sensory inputs gives an idea of the sensory interaction. Patients with peripheral vestibular disorders were examined: patients with BPPV, with spontaneous vertigo attacks and with a sudden vestibular deficit. When applying this evaluation technique different formulae or patterns can be found. Firstly complete normal evaluation, which means that there is no influence of the vestibular disturbance upon the PG results. Secondly a normal balance when using all available sensory information, but disturbed balance as soon as one of the sensory inputs is influenced by the test conditions. Thirdly striking destabilization when closing the eyes. Fourthly striking destabilization when misleading the ankle and foot proprioceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common, most often self-limited, vestibular end organ disorder that in some cases may be quite disabling. Recent evidence suggests that some, if not most, cases result from free-floating posterior semicircular canal endolymph particles. We postulate that the particle repositioning maneuver displaces these particles from the posterior canal through the common crus into the utricle, where they no longer induce pathologic responses. Our report focuses on 38 consecutive patients treated with this simple bedside technique during a 10-month period. On follow-up, 26 patients (68.4%) were free of disease, 4 (10.5%) were significantly improved, 4(10.5%) remained unchanged, and 4(10.5%) were lost to follow-up. Of the 4 patients who remained unchanged, 2 underwent successful posterior semicircular canal occlusions. The direction of the nystagmus during the second stage of the maneuver appears important in predicting the efficacy, with reversal of nystagmus denoting a poor response. These findings provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of this disorder.</td>

	<td>Although acute unilateral and/or bilateral vestibular paralysis, known as vestibular neuronitis, is the second most common cause of vertigo (the most common is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), it is fraught with controversies. The clinical symptoms and methods of treatment of vestibular neuronitis are well defined; however, the etiology and pathophysiology of this disorder are still sketchy. Furthermore, there are no specific diagnostic tests available, and unfortunately, there are no animal models for this disorder. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of those controversies using a classical case of vestibular neuronitis.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation in daily medical practice. Recent studies show that vertigo involves considerable social costs before being managed efficiently, as it is often incorrectly diagnosed. Sometimes a psychiatric symptom, the original causes are vestibular in Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, and benign positional vertigo. Ménière's disease to some extent resembles that of progressive autoimmune deafness. Soon, perhaps, the target of the long-suspected immune reactions will be identified and specific treatments will be developed for the rapidly progressing forms. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is certainly a favorite of practitioners because the treatment is so simple. Not all vertigos are so easily cured, and surgery must sometimes be performed. In most cases, retrolabyrinthine vestibular neurectomy, with its acceptable risks, is the operation of choice. New diagnostic techniques, such as dynamic posturography, are interesting, but their use is not as yet clear.</td>

Sémont liberatory maneuver revealed to be much efficient (50% of patients free of disease after a single repositioning manoeuvre).

We describe a particular topographic form concerning probably a cupulolithiasis of the external canal. 53% of cases beneficiated of CT-scan or of magnetic resonance imaging. The frequency and the possibility of pathological associations with BPPV bring to a particular vigilance for the diagnosis and to a particular care in the affirmation of the benignity in the case of long lasting vertigo (superior to 6 months), or when the nystagmus duration in Hallpike position is superior to 60 seconds.</td>

It was statistically confirmed by global judgments of symptoms and signs that improvement rates of positional nystagmus and vertigo were higher in the two groups treated by VT with and without medication than the improvement rate in the medication alone group. In the groups treated by VT, the effects were not influenced by time since onset of disease or by patient age.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a peripheral vestibular disorder affecting the posterior semicircular canal. It is most often idiopathic in nature, though it has been known to occur in patients following head injury, Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma and viral neuronitis. Two basic theories of the pathology of BPPV include cupulolithiasis and canalithiasis. Diagnosis is made by instituting the Hallpike-Dix maneuver to elicit the positional vertigo and nystagmus. While many patients suffer from BPPV on a limited basis, treatment options are available for those individuals with recurrent episodes and permanent BPPV, including surgery and conservative medical exercises and maneuvers. Nursing care is aimed toward teaching the exercises and maneuvers and assisting the patient to adjust the individual lifestyle movements that may precipitate an attack.</td>

	<td>The steps of the examination procedure applied for a correct diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are reviewed. A precise diagnosis is important in view of treatment of this type of vertigo by rehabilitation therapy. Clinical experience supports the concept that the diagnosis has to be based not only on a typical history, but also on the presence of a reproducible vertigo and paroxysmal positioning nystagmus. In the procedure applied in the department, this nystagmus can be reproduced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver under Frenzel's glasses, during electronystagmography (ENG) recording in the position tests, or it can be present in the vestibular habituation training test battery (a battery of 19 maneuvers applied for defining the adequate exercises in the rehabilitation treatment for BPPV). Analysis of the reviewed data in 95 patients showed that one third of the patients described the vertigo in a rather atypical way, while the further testing revealed a typical BPPV. This experience denies any absolute reliability to only history. In fact, only the finding of such a paroxysmal positioning nystagmus is conclusive for confirming BPPV. However, also the presence of such a nystagmus appeared not to be a constant datum, so that in some patients more than one examination was necessary to come to a reliable diagnosis. It is obvious that, for detecting a paroxysmal positioning nystagmus, ENG is less reliable than the Dix-Hallpike maneuver under Frenzel's glasses.</td>

	<td>The diagnostic value or relevance of a vestibular function test is dependent on the whole clinical and functional context of each particular case. It is not the ability to show 'abnormality' in a high number of patients complaining of whatever kind of vertigo, that indicates the relevance of a function test. Neither is relevance of a test based upon the possibility that this test can re-categorize some patients in the same way as has been done by other tests. Each test evaluates some particular functional aspect and this is very different from one test to another. A test is more relevant, i.e. indicates more abnormality when the type of vertigo caused by the dysfunction is also considered. These statements are confirmed by experience in peripheral vestibular disorders, especially benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A paroxysmal positional nystagmus (ppn) (nystagmus and vertigo elicited by movements and manoeuvres) is linked to the problem of provoked vertigo and gives a confirmation of this vertigo by reproducing it in some manoeuvres. Some inconstancy in the reproduction of this ppn may cause difficulties in diagnosis. Caloric tests are the clue for diagnosis of sudden unilateral loss (so-called neuronitis), whereas they give only complementary information for patients with BPPV. Posturography adds information in all categories concerning the standing position and can be interesting in the scope of rehabilitation treatment. The findings of a retrospective study in patients with BPPV (n = 95), compared with patients with Ménière's disease (n = 89) and others with sudden unilateral loss syndrome (n = 48), illustrate these concepts.</td>

Group II (n = 77) comprised patients in whom a well-defined peripheral disorder could be found (typical provoked vertigo as BPPV (n = 30) and Meniere's disease (n = 30)). Group I consisted of s subgroup Ia, including patients with a complete negative classical examination (n = 32), a subgroup Ib with patients showing minor central signs (n = 28), and subgroup Ic comprising patients with slight peripheral indications (n = 21). The findings in SPGIII were compared between these two groups and are discussed in the light of earlier experience with such data in typical peripheral vestibular disorders. Similar sensory interaction patterns were found in both groups, with only small differences between them, suggesting that in some of these cases, especially in subgroups Ia and Ic, vestibular disturbance might be present, which would not have been sufficiently and clearly revealed by the classical tests. Especially the negative effects, i.e. when the withdrawal of a sensory input improved stability instead of aggravating it, which is the opposite to what should be expected, suggest that the other sensory inputs, vision and proprioception, play a role in the definition of the posturographic results in typical vestibular disorders as well as in diagnosis.</td>

	<td>Drug treatment of vertigo is symptomatic. Highly varied classes of drugs are used, and their mechanisms of action are poorly known. The use of these drugs is empiric as they have been insufficiently evaluated. "Emergency" treatment of acute rotatory paroxysmal vertigo includes acetyl-dl-leucine (of unknown mechanism of action), vestibuloplegic drugs (anticholinergic drugs, H1 antihistamines and calcium antagonists), and dopaminergic antagonists (for their antiemetic properties). The length of such treatment should be short so as not to compromise spontaneous vestibular compensation. In case of recurrent or chronic vertigo, in order to avoid unnecessary prescription of antivertigo drugs, the physician must first eliminate non-vestibular vertigo (such as lipothymia, hypoglycemia or phobic manifestations), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (which requires physical therapy) and tumours (such as acoustic neurinome, requiring surgery). To treat Ménière's disease, histaminergics and calcium antagonists are used, as well as drugs that are considered to diminish the pressure of the endolymphatic liquid (diuretics, acetazolamide, hyperosmotic substances). Their superiority to placebo has not been convincingly demonstrated. Vertigo of unknown origin is no longer attributed to vascular causes and cannot justify the prescription of vasodilators of questionable efficacy. H1 antihistamines, histaminergics and calcium antagonists are still prescribed despite the general lack of proper evaluation of their efficacy. The placebo effect probably explains a good part of their therapeutic success. Because of their potential side effects, none of these drugs should be routinely prescribed on a long-term basis.</td>

	<td>The benign paroxystic positional vertigo (BPPV) is defined by brief attacks of rotational vertigo and concomitant rotatory-linear nystagmus, triggered by rapid extension and by lateral head tilt toward the affected ear. Cupulolithiasis of the posterior semi-circular canal from one inner ear is responsible of this peculiar type of positional vertigo. Definition diagnostic criteria are based upon the time history of the burst of rotational vertigo associated with the typical positioning nystagmus induced by rapid position changes from the setting to the head hanging right or left position during the Nylen-Barany maneuver. The nystagmus, which is a torsional nystagmus of the eye-balls rolling on the orbit's ground toward the affected and undermost ear, begins a few seconds after the head tilt, is best seen with Frentzel's glasses, preventing the suppression of the nystagmus by fixation, and the repetition of the maneuver will result in everlasting symptoms. According to the largest series of the literature the BPPV is the most frequent recognized cause of vertigo, with more than 30% of the cases of vertigo, explored in a dizziness clinic. In half of the cases, a peculiar etiology can be found, such as head trauma, ototoxic drug, or viral labyrinthitis, with a sex-ratio of one. On the contrary the sex-ratio among the idiopathic forms of BPPV is of two females for one male. The prognosis of BPPV is benign because of its recovery within weeks or months, either spontaneously, or after the liberatory maneuver. In rare cases, the vertigo recurs or persists for months or years. For some very handicapping BPPV, a surgical treatment can be proposed.</td>

	<td>Unilateral benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) may mimic bilateral BPPV if the diagnostic positioning maneuver is executed without appropriate alignment of the head and neck with the trunk. Appropriate alignment is achieved by adjusting the plane of the affected posterior semicircular canal so that it is parallel to the plane of diagnostic head tilt, ie, 45 degrees horizontal head rotation to the left before a head tilt to the right in suspected right-sided BPPV. With inappropriate head alignment and head tilt to the side of the unaffected ear, a free-floating clot within the long arm of the uppermost posterior canal may gravitate toward the cupula and become settled on it. This causes ampullopetal cupulolithiasis, evoking geotropic nystagmus, which may mimic BPPV of the unaffected ear. This hypothesis explains the seemingly paradoxical observation of immediate relief from "bilateral BPPV" following unilateral surgical canal occlusion on the "more symptomatic" side.</td>

Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was found in seven MC patients (22%) and altered vestibular function test values in other seven subjects (22%). Moreover, anamnestic and clinical data revealed a high incidence of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo in our MC series. We can suppose that immune complex-mediated microvascular involvement of the labyrinthine vessels may be responsible for inner ear damage in MC. Thus, audiovestibular disturbances may be included among various organ involvement of the MC.</td>

	<td>The subjective visual vertical, SV, was measured in the upright and side positions in 25 normal subjects and in 73 patients with various peripheral vestibular disorders. Significant deviations of SV (toward the affected ear) were found in 100% of the patients with vestibular nerve section and with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, in 89% of the patients with vestibular neuritis, and in 0% of the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The deviation of SV gradually disappeared within a few weeks of the onset of the disease in all patients except in those with total VIIth nerve resection. SV is a parameter of tonic afferent differences between the two labyrinths similar to vestibular spontaneous nystagmus but is mediated by other parts of the inner ear (probably the otolith organs) and thus provides additional information on the labyrinthine function. SV measured in 90 degrees side positions, however, did not reveal asymmetric vestibular sensitivity, which is in contrast to SV tested during eccentric rotation in patients after vestibular neurectomy.</td>

	<td>Among all patients presenting with acute vertigo, majority will be suffering from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis or Meniere's disease. One of the most important central vestibular disorder that imitates labyrinthine dysfunction is vertebrobasilar artery disease. To differentiate this condition from peripheral vestibular lesions, particular attention should be directed to the type of nystagmus which is present. Additionally, duration of vertigo and further neurological symptoms and signs are crucial for correct localization and etiology of the underlying disorder.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a frequent and debilitating complications of head injury and accounts for increasing numbers of medico-legal claims. A detailed neuro-otological study was carried out from the records of 100 patients with post-traumatic dizziness to explore the neuro-otological basis of their symptoms: 50 patients presenting for medico-legal purposes (group I) and 50 presenting for management of their vestibular symptoms (group II). The two groups showed a similar sex distribution, a similar range of causes of head injury and similar severity of head injury (72 minor, 24 moderate and 4 severe). Of the 100, 88 showed at least one audio-vestibular abnormality on testing. Vertigo of the benign positional paroxysmal type was the commonest vestibular diagnosis in both groups (61/100), and only 8 patients showed central vestibular abnormalities. Fifty-three patients had audiometric abnormalities attributable to the head injury, the commonest of which was a high-tone sensorineural hearing loss. There was no significant difference in the incidence of any of the abnormalities in the medico-legal group (group I) when compared with the symptom management group (group II). The results provide strong evidence for an organic basis to recurring dizziness after head injury, whether or not a claim for compensation is pending, and emphasize the need for specialist neuro-otological investigation if abnormalities are to be identified and managed correctly.</td>

	<td>My clinical and laboratory observations support the theoretical concept that the mechanism of typical nystagmus, and most forms of atypical transient nystagmus, is hydrodynamic drag by gravitating free densities--most commonly displaced otoconia--in the endolymph of a semicircular canal; and that these "canaliths" have a significant mechanical advantage, by virture of the canal/ampulla cross-sectional differential, over densities acting directly on the cupula. Positional vertigo related to apparent canalithiasis (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) is a common cause of incapacitation. The profile of the concomitant nystagmus localizes the semicircular canal involved. The canalith repositioning procedure, appropriately administered and targeted according to the observed nystagmus, provides a highly effective means for control of symptoms and a valuable resource for diagnostic evaluation of the more complex case. Surgery is rarely indicated.</td>

If this is true, the syndrome would offer the unique possibility to study vestibular responses when just one single semicircular canal is excited. In this study we used search coils to measure 3-D eye positions in 3 patients with BPPN. We present a complete 3-D description of the eye movements induced in BPPN. We found that in our patients the eyes rotate rather precisely in the plane of one posterior semicircular canal, suggesting that BPPN in our cases is indeed solely produced by the posterior semicircular canal.</td>

There was a significant (P = .0156) decrease in the VOR from stimulation of the operated ear following singular neurectomy.

Nystagmus in the lateral type was horizontal and that in the sagittal type was rotatory. In all types, the vertigo and nystagmus began with a few seconds' latency after head tilt and briefly increased to a maximum, and then gradually decreased. The duration of horizontal nystagmus in the lateral and mixed type was significantly longer than that of rotatory nystagmus in the sagittal type mixed type. The mean value of the former was 90.6 s and that of the latter 18.1 s.

One case with left side BPPV was investigated pre and post-operatively. Depression of the vertical and torsional VOR gain was seen 1 week postoperatively when the occluded canal was placed in the optimal plane for stimulation at 1 week postoperatively and subsequently gradually recovered. Recordings in other planes suggested that the contralateral posterior canal was also hypofunctioning, a finding which may explain some residual gait unsteadiness in this case. The other 3 cases who were investigated postoperatively all showed a decrease in downward VOR gain in the "on' direction of the operated canal.

	<td>The canalith repositioning procedure has recently gained controversial recognition as a treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Some authors contend that the canalith repositioning maneuver is no more effective than no treatment at all. Unfortunately, its technique has not been uniformly applied and its outcomes have not been uniformly assessed. I have found the use of mastoid oscillation to be critical in the success of this procedure. Another important factor is the time interval between diagnosis and relief of symptoms. Because it is well known that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can spontaneously resolve after many months, the time frame for comparison should be short. A 1-week time interval was chosen for study purposes. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to three initial groups. The control group (n = 23) was not given any treatment. A second group (n = 27) was given treatment with the canalith repositioning maneuver with mastoid vibration. A third group (n = 10) was assigned to receive the canalith repositioning maneuver without mastoid vibration. Resolution was defined as no symptoms and negative Dix-Hallpike test results. The results showed that none of the control group's symptoms resolved completely in 1 week. Although 60% of those who received the canalith repositioning maneuver without mastoid vibration felt improved, none was free of nystagmus. An overwhelming 92% of those who received the canalith repositioning maneuver with mastoid vibration felt improved, and 70% were free of rotatory nystagmus after only one treatment. A review of all patients diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and treated with the canalith repositioning maneuver with mastoid vibration was also undertaken. In a series of 67 patients with a minimum of four weeks of follow-up, only two have not responded to the canalith repositioning maneuver, yielding a 97% rate of symptom control.</td>

On the other side, the search for anticochlear antibodies gives a positive result in 45% of the vasculotensional diseases. When the vasculotensional disease is associated with sudden deafness, this percentage increases. On the contrary, it is lower when the vasculotensional disease is associated with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The presence of anticochlear antibodies may lead to a corticotherapy in case of failure of the classical treatments.</td>

Vestibular centres in the brain use this signal, in cooperation with visual and somatosensory signals, to detect the motion of the head and its position relative to gravity vector and to produce motor reflexes to maintain equilibrium and accurate vision during head movements. The evaluation of vestibular function is the mainstay of the general otoneurological examination and relies upon testing for static and dynamic imbalance in the vestibular system, positional testing, eye movement testing and testing for visual-vestibular interaction. The more recent aspects of two conditions, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and ocular tilt reaction, are discussed. Their pathophysiological mechanisms are reinterpreted and re-evaluated on the basis of present knowledge of vestibulo-oculomotor function.</td>

	<td>A practical clinical view of the reliability of the data obtained in the several steps of the examination procedure is discussed to obtain an objective basis for the selection of patients with provoked vertigo (benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo [BPPV]) in view of treatment of this type of vertigo by rehabilitation therapy. Clinical experience supports the concept that the diagnosis has to be based not only upon a typical history, but also upon the presence of a reproducible vertigo and paroxysmal positional nystagmus (ppn). Such a ppn can be reproduced not only as a "classic" nystagmus by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, but also as a positional nystagmus and vertigo during electronystagmographic recording in the position tests and in the vestibular habituation training (VHT)-test battery (a battery of 19 maneuvers applied for defining the adequate exercises in the rehabilitation treatment of BPPV). The ppn is not a constant reproductible sign in every patient, and in some, only one of these tests confirms the BPPV. This experience is confirmed by the analysis of the reviewed data in 95 patients, which showed that one third of the patients described their vertigo in a rather atypical way, whereas further testing revealed a BPPV. In this way any absolute reliability of history has to be denied. In fact, only the finding of a ppn is conclusive for confirming BPPV. However, as in former experiences, here too, the presence of such a ppn appeared not to be a constant datum, so that in some patients more than one examination was necessary to come to a reliable diagnosis. Patients in whom only vertigo could be reproduced, never confirmed by nystagmus, were excluded as an atypical ppv group.</td>

The head extension effect in posturography was evaluated by comparing the results of testing with head extension on a stable platform and on foam rubber to testing with a normal head position. In normal subjects head extension increased the postural sway, but there was no more effect on foam rubber than on the stable platform. For patients with peripheral vestibular disorders the head extension effect on the measured postural sway was evaluated by the difference from the normal condition. This difference could be positive, zero, or negative on the stable platform as well as on foam rubber. In both patients and normal subjects, foam rubber had no more effect than the stable platform. The several types of results could be seen in each category of peripheral vestibular disorders. Only minor nuances could be observed: positive differences were more pronounced in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, whereas negative ones were more obvious in unilateral vestibular deficits. These findings, moreover, deny that head extension in SPGIII should be considered a condition revealing vestibular dysfunction, as has been supposed. As head extension has an influence on the neck proprioceptor as well as on the position of the otoliths, its effect is ambiguous, which makes the interpretation rather difficult. A neck proprioceptive as well as an otolithic explanation appears to have some clinical support.</td>

Vertigo can be thought of as a subjective disturbance of the integration of different sensory inputs. The history and subjective characterisation of vertigo often provide enough information for initial differential diagnosis and recommendation for a specific evaluation. The evaluation includes simple tests of posture and gait, tests of ocular motility, and examination of nystagmus. Instability and nystagmus towards a specific direction point to a vestibular disorder, especially if the nystagmus is suppressed by optical fixation. The most common causes of a vestibular disorder are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a sudden vestibular loss (or vestibular neuritis), and Ménière's disease.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo, and has a typical constellation of physical findings. Atypical forms of paroxysmal positional nystagmus (APPN) also exist, and are thought to represent conditions which are in fact not "benign". We studied 100 consecutive patients with positional vertigo in order to learn whether APPN differed from classic BPPV in etiology or clinical fate, and to learn the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders in these patients. APPN was present in 38% of these patients with diverse causes. One-fourth had CNS disorders or vascular insufficiency, the remainder, otogenic or idiopathic. APPN was more likely than BPPV to have a prolonged (persistent or recurring) clinical course. Although most cases eventually resolved, duration of symptoms tended to be longer, regardless of etiology. We conclude that APPN has a less favorable prognosis than typical BPPV, and that a CNS etiology should be suspected in prolonged cases.</td>

	<td>Bithermal caloric stimulation in a patient with a benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo of the horizontal (lateral) semicircular canal (HC-BPPV) revealed a significant hypoexcitability of the affected ear that was reversible when treated by liberatory maneuvers. Both the positional vertigo and caloric hypoexcitability in HC-BPPV are caused by canalolithiasis, a concept strongly supported by the intensity of the positioning nystagmus being maximal when the patient turned his head around the longitudinal z-axis from the left lateral to right lateral position while recumbent (maximum slow-phase velocity [SPV] 176 deg/sec) and being much lower (maximum SPV 55 deg/sec) when he turned his head to the right lateral position while in a supine position (nose up). The dependence of this difference in nystagmus intensity on the initial head position and direction of rotation indirectly proves that the clot moves freely (to and fro) within the segment of the HC diametrically opposite to the ampulla. The reversibility of ipsilateral caloric hypoexcitability is attributed to the clot's (functional) plugging of the HC, which agrees with studies in squirrel monkeys. These data support the view that physiologic caloric responses consist of a major convective and minor nonconvective component.</td>

	<td>Seventeen percent of all vertiginous patients have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Treatment can include occlusion of the posterior semicircular canal for control of these positional vertigo symptoms. More recently, use of an argon laser technique to occlude the posterior membranous semicircular canal has been proposed. However, this laser technique was not tolerated by a diabetic patient. This report describes a new technique using the argon laser to ablate the utricular macula in the affected ear in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. This procedure is done as outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. The procedure successfully resolved benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in 14 patients. Symptoms in these patients improved from 20-100% (median 87%; mean 80%) as measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory.</td>

	<td>The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of mechanical and laser-assisted posterior semicircular canal occlusion (PCO) for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Twelve consecutive patients with intractable BPPV underwent PCO by three surgeons, six with mechanical PCO and six with CO2 laser-assisted PCO. PCO eliminated positional vertigo in all patients treated with the laser and five of six patients treated without the laser. Dysequilibrium was present in all patients immediately postoperatively. This resolved in all patients treated with the CO2 laser but in only two of six patients treated without the laser (p = 0.03). Patients were hospitalized for dysequilibrium for an average of 5.2 and 2.8 days for the mechanical and laser-assisted groups, respectively. Preoperative and postoperative hearing was not significantly different between the groups. No clinically significant postoperative hearing loss was encountered in either group. These results suggest that PCO is an effective treatment for intractable BPPV. The incidence of dysequilibrium that persists following PCO may be reduced by using the CO2 laser to seal the membranous canal prior to occluding the bony canal.</td>

	<td>The perception of body verticality (subjective postural vertical, SPV) was assessed in normal subjects and in patients with peripheral and central vestibular lesions and the data were compared with conventional neuro-otological assessments. Subjects were seated with eyes closed in a motorized gimbal which executed cycles of tilt at low constant speed (1.5 degrees s-1), both in the frontal (roll) and sagittal (pitch) planes. Subjects indicated with a joystick when they entered and left verticality, thus defining a sector of subjective uprightness in each plane. The mean angle of tilt (identifying a bias of the SPV) and the width of the sector (defining sensitivity of the SPV) were then determined. In normal subjects, the angle of the "verticality' sector was 5.9 degrees for pitch and roll. Patients with bilateral absence of vestibular function, patients with vertigo, i.e. acute unilateral lesions, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Ménière's disease, and patients with positionally modulated up-/downbeat nystagmus all had enlarged sectors (i.e. loss in sensitivity). Mean sector angle in these groups ranged from 7.8 to 11 degrees and the abnormality was present both in pitch and roll, regardless of the direction of nystagmus or body sway. Patients with chronic unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions and those with position-independent vertical nystagmus had normal sensitivities. No significant bias of the SPV was found in any patient group, not even those with acute unilateral vestibular lesions who had marked tilts of the subjective visual vertical (SVV). Complementary experiments in normal subjects tested under galvanic vestibular or roll-plane optokinetic stimulation also failed to show biases of the SPV. In contrast, a significant bias in the SPV could be induced in normal subjects by asymmetric cycles of gimbals tilt, presumably by proprioceptive adaptation. The following conclusions can be drawn. (i) The perception of body verticality whilst seated is mainly dependent on proprioceptive/contact cues but these are susceptible to tilt-mediated adaptation. (ii) Vestibular input improves the sensitivity of the SPV, even in vestibular disorders, as long as the abnormality is stable. (iii) There can be marked dissociation between vestibulo-motor (ocular and postural) phenomena and the perception of body verticality, and between the SPV and SVV. (iv) The postural sway asymmetries in patients with peripheral and central vestibular lesions, like those induced by galvanic or optokinetic stimulation in normal subjects, are not consequences of changes of the SPV.</td>

	<td>The purpose of the present work has been to evaluate the effectiveness of the Semont's liberatory maneuver in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) stemming from lithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal. After taking an overview of the history, epidemiology and clinical manifestation of this pathology, the cases studied are presented: 165 cases of BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal diagnosed between September 1992 and December 1994 at the Audiology and E.N.T. Clinic of the Santo Spirito Hospital in Casale Monferrato, Italy. Diagnosis was based on careful examination of the case history and the finding of typical paroxysmal positional vertigo. Among the 1096 patients who came under observation for vertigo or instability, the incidence of BPPV was rather high: approximately 23%, predominantly females (64% of the cases). In 56% of the cases the right labyrinth was involved while the left labyrinth was involved in 39% (in 5% the form was bilateral). The average age of the patients was 60 years, with incidence being greatest in the 6th and 7th decades of life. In 10% of the cases the etiology was traumatic (cranial, cervical trauma or post otological or general surgery), in 5% it was of viral origin, in 1% of vascular origin; however, in the vast majority of cases (84%) it was idiopathic. All the patients were treated with the Semont's liberatory maneuver (repeated 1-3 times in subsequent sessions at 48 hour intervals). A full 62% of the patients treated were freed of the disorder after a single maneuver and 95.5% after 3 treatments. In 5% of the cases (3 very elderly patients), the disorder persisted even after rehabilitation with Brand Daroff's exercises. To evaluate the evolution in time, all the patients were sent a written questionnaire aimed at determining the progression of symptoms, any recurrences, the number of recurrences, and the length of time from the date of treatment. In the case of positive response, the patients were invited in for a clinical-instrumental check-up. This follow-up ranged from 6 to 30 months. At the end of May 1995 the case breakdown was as follows: 80.7% of the patients were still symptom free, most being quite satisfied with the results; 18% had had one or more recurrence of the paroxysmal positional vertigo which were successfully treated by one or more application of the Semont's maneuver.</td>

Sixty-three cases of BPPV of the horizontal canal type have been reviewed. It is characterised by horizontal nystagmus and an intense vertigo, provoked by rotation of the head in a supine patient. The horizontal nystagmus beats towards the ground on both sides, becomes more pronounced when lying on the pathological side, and then the nystagmus often changes direction. Forty-eight patients underwent electronystagmography. On the pathological side, the first phase nystagmus had a mean latency of three seconds and a mean duration of 31.6 seconds. Nystagmus inversion occurred in 36 patients after a nystagmus free interval. The mean second phase nystagmus duration lasted 33.4 seconds. On the healthy side, the nystagmus had a mean latency of 3.4 seconds and a mean duration of 39.5 seconds. Fatigue was seen in six patients. Simultaneous involvement of the posterior canal was present in 16 patients. A liberatory manoeuvre was successful in six patients. The liberatory manoeuvre should be tried in patients with horizontal canal vertigo. It should not be performed in patients with severe cervical arthrosis, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or when the patient has neck pain during the manoeuvre.</td>

A computed search was conducted using the Index Medicus database (1966-1994) and Current Contents Science Editions. Studies were selected for analysis if the article addressed the sensitivity and/or specificity of platform posturography, compared posturography with another objective test of vestibular function, identified the basis for abnormal test results, and reported the data with sufficient detail to calculate an effect size from a 2 x 2 contingency table. A count of the normal and abnormal test results for posturography and the criterion standard were retrieved from each article, analyzed using a chi 2 statistic, and converted to an effect size. A positive effect size indicated that posturography identified abnormalities in patients who had normal tests on the criterion standard. Sensitivity and specificity of posturography were about 50%. The overall effect size was small (0.13) but positive. The diagnostic category had a significant influence on the predictive value of abnormal results (73% for Meniere's disease and BPPV, compared with 41% for PVD, and 44% for mixed CNS and PVD (F2,12 = 5.26, P = .02) and on the magnitude of the effect size (0.41 for mixed CNS and PVD compared with 0.22 for Meniere's disease and BPPV, and -0.10 for PVD (F2,12 = 13.95, P = .001).

Initially, 57 (83.8%) cases had no evidence of residual symptoms, 10 (14.7%) had a partial improvement, and only 1 (1.5%) failed treatment. In the long-term (18.7 month mean follow-up period), 43 (67.2%) cases had no history of recurrence, and 22 (34.4%) cases had recurrences, of which 14 (21.9%) experienced only mild symptoms, and 8 (12.5%) were no better than before the PRM. Of the eight who were no better, five had repeat PRMs that successfully relieved their symptoms. The final overall outcome was that 59 (95.2%) patients had either mild symptoms or no symptoms, and 3 (4.8%) patients were treatment failures. Factors that did not seem to be predictive of outcome were secondary nystagmus, gender, and duration of symptoms. In both the short and long terms, the self-limited form of BPPV was found to have the best outcome, the episodic type had an intermediate outcome, and the prolonged type had the worst outcome. We postulate that outcomes are best in those cases where free-floating canaliths are the mechanism of disease, which includes patients with self-limited BPPV. Patients with episodic or prolonged BPPV may have varying degrees of underlying cupulolithiasis that cannot be entirely corrected with PRM alone.</td>

The true nature of the disorder may be missed unless examination is carried out in a certain way: the head must be positioned below the rest of the body and turned to one or other side. Diagnosis then depends on the occurrence of vertigo and on noting the transient nystagmus. There are a number of causes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo-head injury is a relatively frequent one. It has been suggested that this disorder is due to deposits on the cupula of the precipitating posterior semicircular canal. Indeed, exercises designed to dislodge such deposits can be successful. If not, and the vertigo lasts for more than a few months, surgery can be considered.</td>

The diseases were Meniere's disease, vestibular schwannoma, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, sudden deafness, and traumatic vertigo. The prevalence of tinnitus in the study population was 76%. The most severe forms of vertigo and nausea were found in vestibular neuritis, whereas the most severe case of tinnitus appeared in Meniere's disease. Of the patients with vestibular schwannoma, 49% had had vertigo. A linear discrimination analysis using case history classified 90% of the patients into correct groups. The key questions discriminating between the diseases concerned the frequency and duration of vertigo attacks, the duration of hearing loss and vertigo, and the occurrence of head injury. Making a correct diagnosis during the first office visit can be difficult, especially for sudden deafness, vestibular schwannoma, and Meniere's disease. Neurotologic and audiometric information was of minor value in distinguishing between these six diseases. Vestibular schwannoma had significantly greater asymmetry in electronystagmography and smaller gains in smooth pursuit in comparison with the other disease. Factorial analysis did not aid the clustering of these diseases.</td>

It was long believed that the condition was caused by inorganic particles in the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). More recently it has been suggested that BPPV may result from free-floating densities in the endolymph of the long arm of the PSC. Among the various treatment modalities used, two maneuvers, each based on a different theory of pathogenesis, have reported equally high success in the control of this disorder. These maneuvers are customarily followed by strict post-treatment instructions. We studied patients with BPPV prospectively by comparing the therapeutic effectiveness of these two modalities and studying the importance of post-treatment instructions in affecting the final outcome in each modality. We showed that both maneuvers were equally successful in controlling the symptoms and that post-treatment instructions were not necessary.</td>

	<td>122 (8): 845-848</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>Benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) is generally thought to be caused by canalolithiasis in the posterior semicircular canal, an organ that is innervated by the inferior vestibular nerve. We hypothesized that absent vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) would indicate involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve and that posterior semicircular canal-type BPPV could not develop after vestibular neurolabyrinthitis (VNL) in patients with absent VEMPs. To find out if VEMPs could be helpful in evaluating involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve in acute VNL. We reviewed the VEMP findings in 47 patients (34 men and 13 women) with acute VNL, 10 of whom had then developed posterior semicircular canal-type BPPV. While p13-n23, the first positive-negative peak of the VEMP, was ipsilaterally present on stimulation of the unaffected side in all patients, it was absent on the affected side in 16 patients (34%). The absence or presence of p13-n23 was independent of the results of caloric tests, pure tone audiometry, and auditory brain-stem responses. Typical posterior semicircular canal BPPV developed in 10 of the 47 patients after the acute attack of VNL, always on the same side as the neurolabyrinthitis. The p13-n23 potentials were preserved on stimulation of the affected ear in all 10 patients with BPPV. These results suggest that if VEMPs are absent from an ear that has suffered acute VNL, then posterior semicircular canal BPPV is unlikely to develop as a consequence of the VNL. The reason for this appears to be that the absence of VEMPs is due to involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve or involvement of the structures that it innervates.</td>

In most cases, nystagmus is geotropic and more intense when the pathological ear is lowermost; less often the syndrome presents with apogeotropic nystagmus that is more intense when the affected ear is uppermost. The nystagmus pattern may vary in time in the same patient, changing from apogeotropic to geotropic even in observations at short intervals. In some patients, the features indicate involvement of more than one canal, either simultaneously or in succession. It is sustained that the clinical findings can be explained by movement of endolymph caused by displacement of otoconia in the semicircular canals and that variants are due to different positions of the otoconia within the canals.</td>

	<td>We report on 2 patients with typical features of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (h-BPPV). A vigorous head positioning in these patients from supine to a bending-over, head-on-the-knees position reversed the direction of nystagmus from geotropic initially to ageotropic when rolling the head from side to side while supine. We explain this by a conversion of canalolithiasis into cupulolithiasis and conclude that (1) canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis may sequentially occur in the same semicircular canal with subsequent positioning maneuvers and (2) positional nystagmus beating toward the uppermost ear is not a pathognomonic sign of central vestibular disturbance but can indicate occasional cupulolithiasis.</td>

	<td>Bull frogs posterior semicircular canals (psc) wee used to simulate the condition of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The psc was isolated in frog Ringer's solution, and the saccular otoconia were used as a responsible material to stimulate the cupula. When the otoconia were placed on the cupular surface to mimic the condition of cupulolithiasis, the psc ampullary nerve action potentials instantaneously changed according to the direction of the gravity produced by otoconia. When the otoconia were dropped into the canal to mimic the condition of moving otoconia in the canal, the action potentials changed together with the otoconial flow after a latent period. Both cupulolithiasis and moving otoconia are possibly valid mechanisms of BPPV, since they effectively stimulate the cupula. However, moving otoconia with a latent period would better explain clinical features of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is assumed to result from utricular damage, but it is controversial if patients have manifest utricular dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated linear vestibulo-ocular reflexes (LVORs) during lateral whole-body translation in 14 patients with unilateral BPPV. Patients were subjected to linear acceleration steps of 0.24 g along the interaural axis, which were applied randomly to the left and right, both in the dark and in the light with a visual target at a distance of 60 cm. The LVOR was measured by EOG from the slow phase velocity of the averaged and desaccaded compensatory eye movement. In normal cases, maximum asymmetry of LVOR velocity was 13% in the dark and 10% in the light. In patients, LVOR velocities were normal in the dark but mildly reduced in the light (p < 0.05). Five patients had mild LVOR asymmetries in the dark (range 18-38%) and two in the light (11 and 13%), but there was no consistent relationship to the affected side. The absence of gross changes of the LVOR may be explained either by minor utricular damage that is functionally irrelevant or by central compensation of a chronic unilateral deficit.</td>

However, the specific subset of this patient population with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is more defined. Cupololithiasis and canalithiasis are perhaps the best known and best described pathologic conditions resulting in vertigo. This condition occurs when otoconia from the utricle are displaced into the Posterior semicircular canal-cupula. The abnormal position of the otoconia often results in a pathological condition. The location of displacement is most often in the posterior semicircular canal. A better understanding of the etiology of BPPV has led to a simple and effective particle repositioning maneuver that allows the practitioner to alleviate vertigo symptoms for most patients using a simple manipulation.</td>

	<td>This article discusses the pathophysiology, evidence of treatment efficacy, and factors that contribute to improved treatment outcome in three different vestibular disorders. In patients with unilateral and bilateral vestibular loss, recent research suggests that customized, supervised exercises facilitate recovery of postural stability. These exercises are based on knowledge of normal vestibular function as well as on our understanding of the various compensatory mechanisms that can contribute to recovery. Recognizing the limitations of these compensatory mechanisms as substitutes for lost vestibular function is important in establishing treatment goals. Treatment of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is based on the identification of the specific canal involved and the anatomy of the labyrinth. Although patients with BPPV primarily experience brief episodes of vertigo, this disorder is also associated with postural instability, which may not resolve with remission of the positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has received renewed clinical interest. At the Johns Hopkins Otological Vestibular Laboratory, 781 patients were tested on more than one occasion between September 1976 and November 1992. Of these patients, 187 (24%) were found to have positional nystagmus consistent with a diagnosis of BPPV. A retrospective analysis of these patients' records, including vestibular test and eye movement reports, audiograms, questionnaires, and hospital charts was performed. After this review, the nystagmus, initially diagnosed as due to BPPV, was believed to be a manifestation of another disease process in 36 cases. Of the remaining 151 cases, 52 (34%) presented with no significant preceding disorder and have been termed primary BPPV. In the remaining 99 patients we found coexisting or associated disorders which included Meniere's disease, head trauma, prior ear surgery, vestibular neuronitis, migraine, and others. Forty-five of these 151 patients (31%) had an associated diagnosis of Meniere's disease. To our knowledge a significant association between Meniere's disease and BPPV has not been reported. A review of the literature with discussion of BPPV and the associated disorders is offered.</td>

	<td>The original description of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) has been variously attributed to Bárány, Adler, and others. In addition, the proper eponymic designation for the provocative positioning test used to diagnose BPPV has been unclear, because authors use a variety of different terms, including Bárány, Nylén-Bárány, Nylén, Hallpike, Hallpike-Dix, and Dix-Hallpike to refer to the procedure in current use. Based on a review of the extant medical literature, Bárány was the first to describe the condition in detail, and Dix and Hallpike were the first to clearly describe both the currently used provocative positioning technique and the essential clinical manifestations of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo elicited by that technique. Nevertheless, despite their important contributions, neither Bárány nor Dix and Hallpike understood the pathophysiology of BPPV nor did they appreciate that the positioning techniques they used actually demonstrated pathology in the semicircular canals rather than the utricle. The modern understanding of the pathophysiology of BPPV began with Schuknecht's proposal that the dysfunction resulted from the gravity-dependent movement of loose or fixed dense material within the posterior semicircular canal ("cupulolithiasis"). Although Schuknecht's formulations were not consistent with all clinical features of the disease, they led to the modern "canalolithiasis theory" and highly effective canalith repositioning or "liberatory" maneuvers for BPPV.</td>

	<td>Neurovascular compression syndrome of the 5th and 7th cranial nerves has been recognized as the cause of trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm. On the other hand, it is still difficult to diagnose vertigo as neurovascular compression syndrome of the 8th cranial nerve. To detect some specific finding in this syndrome of the 8th cranial nerve, 5 patients with vertigo with hemifacial spasm were examined for the clinical course and neuro-otological features. In all patients MRI and/or angiography suggested vascular compression against the 8th cranial nerve. The clinical courses of these patients revealed various symptoms resembling benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuronitis and Meniere's disease. Audiograms showed two normal hearing patterns, bilateral high frequency hearing loss probably due to aging in one case, bilateral C5-dip in one and fluctuating unilateral hearing loss like Meniere's disease in one. The prolongation of IPL I-III on auditory brainstem response proposed as a criterion by Møller was detected in one case. No response in the caloric test was found in two cases. These abnormalities in the auditory brainstem response and caloric test appeared to be useful for diagnosis but were uncommon findings in all cases. Electronystagmographic examinations including the eye tracking test, optokinetic nystagmus and optokinetic pattern were all normal. We could not find any specific clinical findings valuable for diagnosis of neurovascular compression syndrome of the 8th cranial nerve. It is proposed that the indication of microvascular decompression should be decided carefully.</td>

All patients had normal cochleovestibular test results and showed no signs of concomitant internal and/or central pathologies. The Hallpike maneuver was able to evoke an intense symmetrical paroxysmal vertigo and this was often accompanied by neurovegetative phenomena while paroxysmal nystagmus always appeared. The patients were treated with a rehabilitative technique: the Brandt-Daroff was preferred as it is better tolerated. Within 15 days all patients had full remission of symptoms and at 6 months after treatment there have been no signs of recurrence. The conclusion is, thus, drawn that while the technical characteristics of the Sémont maneuver make it suitable only for use as rehabilitation in unilateral benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, this experience indicates that the Brandt-Daroff technique is better suited for the bilateral forms of this disorder.</td>

Segments of the superior and inferior vestibular nerves were surgically removed, preserved in glutaraldehyde, examined by electronmicroscopy, and the findings were correlated with the clinical diagnosis. A variety of different types of pathologic lesions were identified, including axon and supporting cell degeneration, herpes zoster virus, other viruses, results of bacterial infection, and regrowth of nerve after surgical resection. The vestibular nerves were found to be histologically normal in lesions primarily involving the end organ such as most early Meniere's disease cases, benign paroxysmal postural vertigo (BPPV), and mild labyrinthine concussion. Vestibular nerve degeneration was seen with advanced Meniere's disease, severe labyrinthine concussion, and with vascular loops in the internal auditory canal. Herpes zoster involves Scarpa ganglion in herpes zoster oticus. Viruses were found in the nuclei of vestibular nerve cells in a patient with delayed hydrops. Regrowth of the vestibular nerve after surgical resection was confirmed in three cases.</td>

In order to better define the role of CRP in relieving vertigo, we studied the time course of recovery in 27 consecutive cases of BPPV. We recorded nystagmus after each head maneuver and at each evaluation until complete resolution took place, using absence of nystagmus as a strict criterion for cure. We found that while 93% of patients improved, many had persistent nystagmus at the first evaluation, and in only 63% was resolution clearly related to a CRP session. We believe that in certain cases, the effect of CRP may be due to adaptive conditioning, rather than particle redistribution.</td>

The mean age of onset was 55 years. There was no sex predominance. In most patients, positional vertigo disappeared within 2 months. We then used the eccentric rotatory test to examine the patients otolithic function. In the eccentric rotatory test, a patient is rotated around an axis located behind his head (eccentric rotation, ECR). We have demonstrated that the enhancement of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain in ECR can be used as an index of the utricular function. Enhancement of VOR gain was observed in ECR to the lower ear in positional vertigo, but not to the uppermost ear. The findings suggest an imbalance in utricular function in patients with BPPV. Otoconia dislodged from the deranged utricle may be a source of canalolithiasis/cupulolithiasis.</td>

In this study, we investigated the role of the utricle and semicircular canals (especially the vertical semicircular canal) relative to BPPV by three-dimensional analysis, focusing on the horizontal, vertical, and torsional positions by applying our computerized eye movement analysis system. In 13 subjects who were diagnosed as having BPPV, we carried out the positioning nystagmus tests, and analyzed three components of nystagmus. By using a pendular rotation stimulus, we also measured three components of eye movement elicited from the vertical semicircular canals in 5 normal subjects and 2 subjects from whom acoustic tumors were removed by the translabyrinthine approach. We compared two components (vertical and torsional) of BPPV with those of eye movements elicited from the vertical semicircular canals. In BPPV, the slow phase velocity of the torsional component was greater than that of the vertical component. Conversely, the amplitude of the vertical component from the vertical semicircular canals was greater than that of the torsional component. From these results, by analyzing the vestibuloocular reflex of vertical semicircular canals, it is difficult to support the idea that the pathology of BPPV is located in the posterior semicircular canal alone.</td>

We devised this type of physical treatment in accordance with the "canalolithiasis" theory of BPPV, in order to try to free the horizontal semicircular canal of otoconial debris. We compared the results obtained by Prolonged Position with two other physical therapies by dividing our horizontal canal BPPV patients into three therapeutic groups: 1) 35 patients treated with Prolonged Position; 2) 24 patients treated with head shaking in a supine position; 3) 15 patients for whom therapy was omitted. More than 90% of the patients treated with Prolonged Position recovered within 3 days, although 6 patients out of 35 subsequently developed BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal, which then responded well to a particular repositioning maneuver. The results of Prolonged Position were significantly better than those obtained by performing head shaking or by omitting treatment. Prolonged Position can be applied to patients of all ages and general conditions and does not require hospitalization.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal vertigo and nystagmus are induced not only by the posterior but also by the horizontal semicircular canal. Benign positional nystagmus of the horizontal canal is more often observed than was previously thought. In 10 patients we analyzed the characteristics and the variability of nystagmus which accompanies positional vertigo of the horizontal canal. There are two forms of nystagmus: primary-geotropic, most often paroxysmal nystagmus (7 patients), and primary-apogeotropic, non-paroxysmal nystagmus (3 patients). Interestingly, in 2 patients with the primary-apogeotropic form the nystagmus converted during the examination into the primary-geotropic form. The reverse was not observed. We discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms which could be relevant for provoking manoeuvres.</td>

	<td>The pathoetiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is controversial. Particulate matter within the posterior semicircular canal has been identified intraoperatively in patients with BPPV but has also been reported in non-BPPV patients at the time of translabyrinthine surgery (Parnes LS, McClure JA. Free-floating endolymphatic particles: a new operative finding during posterior semicircular canal occlusion. Laryngoscope 1992;102:988-92; Schuknecht HF, Ruby RRF. Cupulolithiasis.

The nature of the particulate matter remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the posterior semicircular canal of patients with and without a clinical history of BPPV for the presence of particulate matter. Seventy-three patients without BPPV symptoms undergoing labyrinthine surgery (vestibular schwannoma excision or labyrinthectomy) and 26 patients with BPPV undergoing the posterior semicircular canal occlusion procedure were compared. Additionally, 70 archived temporal bones without a history of BPPV were examined microscopically for the presence of particulate matter within the lumen of the membranous labyrinth. No particles were observed intraoperatively in any of the 73 patients without a history of BPPV. Particulate matter was observed in 8 of 26 patients at the time of the posterior semicircular canal occlusion procedure for intractable BPPV. Of the 70 temporal bones examined, 31 did not show significant postmortem changes and also did not demonstrate cupulolithiasis or canalithiasis. Particulate matter from within the membranous posterior semicircular canal was removed from one patient at the time of posterior semicircular canal occlusion for intractable BPPV symptoms and was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The particulate matter appeared morphologically consistent with degenerating otoconia. These data show a statistically significant association between the presence of particles within the posterior semicircular canal in this study and the symptom complex of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Today the canal/cupulolithiasic pathogenesis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) appears well defined; what is less clear is the origin of the postural "instability" often associated with rotatory vertigo. This form is less marked but still resists all know treatments. The purpose of the present study was to determine the actual postural arrangement of subjects suffering from canalolithiasis (CL) of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) both before and after the positioning maneuver. In this case a personal method of spectral frequency analysis was used in an attempt to clarify the origin of the residual "instability" following otolithic repositioning. Static posturographic testing was performed on 20 patients with CL of the PSC and another 20 normal subjects of comparable age. In the present study the repositioning maneuver leads to a reduction in latero-lateral oscillation without any anterior-posterior variation. Such stabilization covers all the frequencies if a visual input is also present while it is limited to the lower frequencies when the visual content is lacking. In fact, in the latter case the subject maintains his posture using only vestibular and proprioceptive input. On the other hand, the anterior-posterior oscillations increase in all frequency ranges and this increase remains essentially unchanged after the repositioning maneuver. The authors feel that the anterior-posterior destabilization seen in CL of the PSC may stem from a proprioceptive-macular alteration linked to otolitic detachment rather than abnormal ampullar stimulation. The persistence and residual postural alterations found could, therefore, explain the persistent sense of instability that CL patients often complain of, even after the maneuvers which have encountered such success in controlling BPPV.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is a subtype of dizziness, which results from an imbalance within the vestibular system. This seminar focuses on three common presentations of vertigo: prolonged spontaneous vertigo, recurrent attacks of vertigo, and positional vertigo. The patient's history is usually the key to differentiation of peripheral and central causes of vertigo. The most common cause of vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, can be cured with a simple positional manoeuvre. Other common causes of vertigo include vestibular neuritis, Ménière's syndrome, migraine, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause whenever possible, but antivertiginous and antiemetic drugs can suppress symptoms when a specific cause cannot be found. These drugs are generally not indicated for long-term daily use, however, since they may interfere with the normal compensation process.</td>

The overall postural control in BPPV patients was shown to be impaired, as demonstrated by the pathological equilibrium scores. Data obtained before treatment showed a specific pattern of vestibular involvement and a pathological composite score. After the liberatory manoeuvre the Sensory Organization Test indicated a significant improvement in the pathological composite and vestibular scores. However, significant differences from controls were still detected 3 days and 1 month after clinical recovery from BPPV. The results clearly show that, in BPPV patients, there is an impairment of the vestibular system, which seems unable to maintain a normal postural balance. This deficit can be particularly detected when dynamic posturography evaluates the vestibular cues. After the liberatory manoeuvre a consistent improvement in the overall postural control has been observed but the residual differences from controls seem to suggest that damage to the otoconial maculae influences postural control, even when there is significant improvement in the clinical signs.</td>

	<td>A new therapy is proposed for the treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (B.P.P.V.) of the Posterior Semicircular Canal (P.S.C.): the Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (C.R.M.). The need for a new maneuver to treat B.P.P.V. of the P.S.C. arises from the difficulties encountered in daily practice, under particular conditions (i.e. elderly, obese, traumatized patients and in the presence of rachis pain, etc.), to perform the most common rehabilitative techniques such as the Semont Maneuver and Epley's Canalith Repositioning Procedure (C.R.P.). The results achieved using this new technique on a group of 47 consecutive out-patients are presented and compared to those achieved using the Semont Maneuver in an analogous group of 23 patients. C.R.M. and the Semont Maneuver were performed once per treatment session and all patients were checked every 3 days until the symptoms of B.P.P.V. disappeared. Thereafter they were invited to return for check-up if signs of vertigo returned (follow-up 6-25 months). The two techniques proved equally effective: 87.5% of the cases were resolved with C.R.M., 82.6% with the Semont Maneuver. However, the C.R.M. provided other advantages as it resolved the problem immediately (i.e. in a single session) in 81% of the cases vs. 68.4% for the Semont Maneuver. In view of the Canalith theory, the action mechanism envisaged for all three maneuvers--C.R.M., the Semont Maneuver and the Epley C.R.P.--can be explained assuming that the canalith passes from the ampullar to the non ampullar branch of the (P.S.C.) passing finally through the Common Duct and into the Utricle. C.R.M. is a specific treatment for the B.P.P.V. of the P.S.C. and is simple to perform, well tolerated and quite effective. It is indicated in all cases of B.P.P.V. of the P.S.C. both as initial treatment and as alternative to other treatment methods which have proved ineffective or difficult to perform. Indeed, in therapy it is best to be quite skilled in more than one technique, availing oneself of a full range possibilities; in this way the cure can be tailored to the patient in each individual case and not vice versa.</td>

	<td>Fifty two patients with positioning nystagmus were studied with the V.N.G. three-dimentional device of ULMER. In benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) the torsionnal component is not pure: a vertical and a less important horizontal components also exist. They are not of the same amplitude on both eyes. The torsionnal and horizontal components are more important on the eye ipsilateral to the BPPV. The vertical component is more important on the contralateral eye. The horizontal canal B.P.V. (2% of the cases of B.P.V.) is so defined by the absence of vertical and torsionnal components. Three-D Eye Movement Analysis is helpful for differential diagnosis with the positional protocol described. The characteristics of central and peripheral paroxysmal positional nystagmus are given. The head Tilt and the ocular counter rolling reflex (O.C.R.) can be quantified with this device. It will be useful in the future to better explore the inferior root of the eighth nerve and the otolith organ. For clarity we propose to describe the torsionnal nystagmus so that the results are expressed with respect to the patient: clockwise nystagmus (in reference to the patient) would thus be also right rotatory nystagmus while left rotatory nystagmus would be also anticlockwise.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common type of vertigo seen by the otolaryngologist; however, intracranial tumors can mimic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in their presentation. A review of patients seen in the Department of Otolaryngology at The Ohio State University between July 1992 and August 1996 identified five patients with intracranial pathologic conditions mimicking benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. These patients were first seen with episodic vertigo associated with positional change. Failure of the symptoms to respond to the particle repositioning maneuver or the finding of associated auditory or neurologic symptoms prompted further evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, which revealed intracranial pathologic conditions including two meningiomas, a vestibular schwannoma, a glioma, and a lipoma. These findings suggest that patients seen with symptoms like those of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who do not show improvement after undergoing the particle repositioning maneuver or those who describe associated auditory or neurologic symptoms should have magnetic resonance imaging done to rule out intracranial pathologic conditions. Additionally, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and intracranial tumors may coexist.</td>

	<td>We reviewed the features of nystagmus in 24 patients with horizontal canal benign positional vertigo (BPV). Patients were treated with canalith repositioning maneuvers. Our goal was to develop a framework for distinguishing horizontal from posterior canal BPV and to further develop a mechanistic model explaining the horizontal canal variant of BPV. The study design was a retrospective case review with prospective treatment outcome and follow-up. The study was performed at a secondary and tertiary referral center for vertigo and dizziness. The diagnosis of horizontal canal BPV was based on: 1) recurrent brief episodes of positional vertigo; 2) paroxysmal bursts of horizontal positional nystagmus; and 3) lack of any other identifiable central nervous system disorder to explain the nystagmus. Patient average age was 62 years, and average duration of symptoms was 12 weeks. We documented patients' symptoms and the characteristics of nystagmus. We reviewed the effectiveness of several similar canalith repositioning treatments. We observed and recorded factors that distinguish horizontal from posterior canal BPV. We monitored the direction of nystagmus, the type of maneuver that evoked the nystagmus, and the response to canalith repositioning. Symptom description alone was not sufficient to distinguish among canal types of BPV. Horizontal geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus was observed in 19 of 24 patients. The other patients had ageotropic nystagmus. Both types were distinct from the nystagmus of posterior canal BPV. Response to canalith repositioning was 75% at 1 week of follow-up. Conversion of BPV from one canal to another occurred in some patients, but each canal could be treated individually. Patients with positional vertigo should undergo Dix-Hallpike positioning and supine lateral head turns to each side. Paroxysmal positional horizontal nystagmus that changes direction with changes in head position strongly suggests the diagnosis. Canalith repositioning for posterior canal BPV may fail in horizontal BPV. A 360 degrees barbecue rotation toward the presumably healthy ear done two to four times or until nystagmus disappears may result in more rapid resolution of symptoms.</td>

	<td>The goal of this investigation was to determine whether there is a familial tendency in the development of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We hypothesized an increased frequency of BPPV among relatives of patients with the same diagnosis. BPPV is caused by dislodged otoconia from the utricular macula floating in the semicircular canals. At least half of BPPV cases are idiopathic and most pathological associations provide no clue as to the reason otoconia become dislodged. We have noted a number of BPPV patients with family histories of BPPV, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition. We surveyed 120 successive BPPV patients and 120 successive dizzy patients without BPPV regarding the frequency of dizziness and BPPV (diagnosed by a physician) among family members. Patients in our group with BPPV were 5 times as likely to have relatives with BPPV compared to the dizzy control group (chi2=5.95, DF=1, p=0.015). We have demonstrated that there is a familial tendency for the occurrence of BPPV. There is nothing in our data that would distinguish between a hereditary or environmental influence in the development of the disease, however.</td>

	<td>The introduction of the Lempert or Baloh "barbecue" maneuver in clinical practice has resolved many cases of paroxysmal positional vertigo of the horizontal semicircular canal. Unfortunately, this maneuver is rather difficult to perform in elderly or overweight patients and in those with reduced mobility. In such cases the Vannucchi "forced position" is the maneuver of choice. Diagnostic confirmation is, however, still a problem. The authors feel diagnosis is only confirmed when the positional nystagmus has been converted, inverted or disappears after the physical therapy maneuver. For this reason another maneuver has been developed and is described in the present work. Between May 10th and November 28th 1997 thirty cases of horizontal canalolithiasis were seen: 19 in the right vestibule, 11 the left vestibule (9 males, 21 females; age range 20 to 82 years). Of these cases, 24 (4 apogeotropic, 20 geotropic) were treated with a maneuver differing from the barbecue maneuver. Some parts of this maneuver are similar to the Semont maneuver, moving the patient from a seated position to a position on the right or left side, depending the pathology and type of vertigo (geotropic/apogeotropic). A favorable outcome was achieved in 22 cases and there was no result in 2 cases. The two non-responsive patients were then treated with forced positioning which resolved the condition. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from horizontal canalolithiasis responds to treatment with the above-mentioned maneuver.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common malfunction of the labyrinth, most frequently of the posterior canal, due to clot of debris in the endolymph. The attacks of vertigo are characterised by dependency on position, latency after positioning of the head, short duration, nystagmus, reversibility and fatiguableness. The diagnosis can be based on history, physical examination and provocative tilting of the head as described by Dix and Hallpike. In a typical case further investigations are not necessary. The symptoms often improve spontaneously. Half of the patients can be cured directly by stepwise tilting. This probably removes the clot from the canal of the labyrinth to the utriculus. Specific positional exercises also often have a good result, but not as quickly. Drug therapy has no place in the treatment.</td>

	<td>Forty-three surgical cases were retrospectively analyzed to establish diagnostic criteria and operative indications for vertigo and tinnitus due to neurovascular compression (NVC) of the eighth cranial nerve (8th N). Many NVC syndromes were mistakenly diagnosed as Ménière's disease or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. NVC was confirmed in 31 of the 43 patients. Neurovascular decompression (NVD) resulted in complete recovery or marked improvement of subjective symptoms in all 19 cases with vertigo (100%), and in 19 of 29 patients with tinnitus (65.5%). Multiple factor analysis revealed that abnormal caloric responses have high diagnostic value for vertigo due to NVC. Vertigo due to NVC is of short duration (a few sec to a few min.) in the early phase of the disease, which becomes longer and hearing becomes impaired as the history of NVC lengthens. Low pitch pulsatile and high pitch continuous tinnitus are probably due to NVC and are cured by NVD if hearing is still preserved. Tinnitus associated with hemifacial spasm is strongly indicative of NVD. Decompression of the 8th N should be performed in the early phase of disease, since cochlear and vestibular functions are irreversibly impaired if NVC continues for a long period of time.</td>

	<td>Positioning nystagmus of the peripheral benign type (BPPV) has long been considered to be due to cupulolithiasis-i.e. attachment of inorganic material to the cupula-of the posterior vertical semicircular canal. Meanwhile it has generally been recognized that not all characteristics of this type of nystagmus/vertigo can be explained by assuming a gravity-dependent reaction of the posterior canal. Canalolithiasis-i.e. floating material within the canal, heavier than endolymphe-of the posterior semicircular canal is now widely regarded as the cause of BPPV. Again, however, this is a concept far too simple to explain most of the properties of BPPV. Clearly defined, carefully performed positioning and positional maneuvers were carried out on 79 patients suffering from typical BPPV in order to reveal those positioning movements and positions necessary to elicit BPPV. Detailed analysis of those positioning maneuvers necessary to elicit BPPV clearly reveals that canalolithiasis cannot be the cause of BBPV. BPPV is a combination of positioning, and positional-dependent reactions in which the otolithic organs, and particularly the sacculus, seem to be involved.</td>

	<td>It is well known that most episodes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), even in untreated, recover spontaneously in 2 to 6 weeks. In the present study, we put forward the hypothesis that this is mainly due to the fact that endolymph, owing to its low calcium content (20 microM) is able to dissolve otoconia. To support this, the fate of frog saccular otoconia immersed in normal endolymph (Ca2+ content 20 microM) and in Ca2+-rich endolymphatic fluids (up to 500 microM) was studied by observing the crystals at regular intervals for 3 weeks. The results demonstrated that normal endolymph can dissolve otoconia very rapidly (in about 20 hours). When the endolymphatic Ca2+ content was increased (50 to 200 microM) otoconia dissolution time was slowed down (about 100 to 130 hours, respectively) and completely stopped when the endolymphatic Ca2+ content was of 500 microM. The present results therefore suggest that the major process involved in the spontaneous recovery of BPPV episodes is the capability of the endolymph to dissolve dislodged otoconia.</td>

	<td>To determine if there is an anatomic basis for the assumption that loose, "rogue" otoliths presumed to arise from the utricular macula and theorized to cause benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) by impinging on semicircular canal ampullae could be returned to their original site by a series of changes in the position of the head called particle repositioning maneuvers (PRMs). Further, if such otolith movement were possible, once they were replaced into the utricle, would they adhere to the utricular macula? Kodachrome photographs of 2-mm-thick macrosections of human temporal bones were available for evaluation. The bones were sectioned in horizontal, coronal, and sagittal planes. Rice grains were placed on the photographs of the cross-sections to demonstrate the possible paths taken by loose otoliths under the influence of gravity in different positions of the head. A study of cross-sections of the temporal bone shows that loose macular otoliths after PRMs would tend to fall into the lumen of the utricle. Once the patient assumes the erect position, however, repositioned otoliths would tend to fall into the near or utriculopetal side of the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal, which opens directly into the inferior portion of the utricle, and could cause labyrinth stimulation and BPPV by the same mechanism of misplaced otoliths on the opposite or far side of the cupula. Loose otoliths in the utricle could also stimulate the horizontal ampullae. PRMs do not remove or fix otoliths in any specific site in the labyrinth. Repositioning of loose otoliths onto the original site in the macula of the utricle, which lies superiorly in the vestibule, could not be accomplished by any of the repositioning maneuvers. If otoliths were to be repositioned on the utricular macula, there is no evidence that the otoliths would adhere to the macula when the patient assumes the erect position. The good results obtained by physiotherapeutic procedures suggest that some other mechanism than repositioning of otoliths is responsible for the relief of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Head positioning can lead to pathological nystagmus and vertigo. In most instances the cause is a peripheral vestibular disorder, as in benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV). Central lesions can lead to positional nystagmus (central PN) or to paroxysmal positioning nystagmus and vertigo (central PPV). Lesions in central PPV are often found dorsolateral to the fourth ventricle or in the dorsal vermis. This localization, together with other clinical features (associated cerebellar and oculomotor signs), generally allows one to easily distinguish central PPV from BPPV. However, in individual cases this may prove difficult, since the two syndromes share many features. Even if only BPPV as a peripheral lesion is considered, differentiation based on such features as latency, course, and duration of nystagmus during an attack, fatigability, vertigo, vomiting, and time period during which nystagmus bouts occur, may be impossible. Only the direction of nystagmus during an attack can allow differentiation.</td>

	<td>This study was performed to determine the relative effectiveness of several passive head maneuvers for treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. This prospective study used 87 subjects diagnosed by their physicians with unilateral benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal. Subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: modified Epley maneuver, modified Epley maneuver with augmented head rotations, and modified Semont maneuver. They were interviewed 1 week after receiving one maneuver. If subjects desired further treatment, they were treated again with the same maneuver, a methodology repeated until subjects desired no further treatment; they were telephoned 3 and 6 months after the last treatment. The groups did not differ significantly, but subjects decreased significantly on vertigo intensity and frequency and improved significantly on independence in activities of daily living. Before treatment, tasks requiring pitch rotations of the head induced vertigo; common comorbid conditions were osteoporosis, cervical spine problems, and head trauma. These data suggest that augmented head rotations are unnecessary and that the modified Epley and Semont maneuvers are equally effective in the remediation of vertigo in this population.</td>

These patients were diagnosed and treated between July 1996 and July 1998 and account for 15% of the 1550 patients complaining of balance and postural disorders seen during that period. Analysis of the results shows BPPV epidemiological data that are practically the same those reported in the literature: greater incidence in females, predominance of posterior canalolithiasis and optimal use of the canalith repositioning techniques. The authors reconfirm the effectiveness of the Semont maneuver and its variations in the treatment of those forms involving the posterior semicircular canal (97% healing). As regards BPPV due to lateral canalolithiasis. The authors feel the vestibular "barbecue" rehabilitation techniques suggested by Lempert--i.e. a 270 degrees rotation starting from the decubitus position on the pathological side, rather than Baloh's traditional 360 degrees rotation--is most suitable for the treatment of BPPV stemming from lateral canalolithiasis. The Lempert technique provided satisfactory results (76% healing) and a reduction in the number of failures (24%).</td>

The condition appears to be caused by free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. The diagnosis is confirmed by eliciting characteristic symptoms and signs during the Dix-Hallpike test. Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is usually a self-limited disorder, treatment with a specific bedside maneuver is effective and can provide the patient immediate and long-lasting relief. Although many patients with positionally provoked vertigo have typical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, physicians should be aware of nonbenign variants.</td>

To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects on the SVV in patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) post Hallpike and Semont maneuvers. Sixteen patients with posterior canal BPPV were assessed in the vestibular clinic in Winnipeg, Manitoba. These patients had assessment of their SVV at baseline, post Hallpike and Semont maneuvers, and at follow-up 2 weeks later. These patients were also compared to a control group (n = 9). Ten of 16 patients showed a statistically significant change in SVV post Hallpike maneuver. An even larger number of patients, 14 of 16, showed a significant difference when compared to the control group post Hallpike. These findings suggest that the inferior vestibular nerve may to some degree influence the ocular tilt reaction.</td>

	<td>Vibrations of 60 Hz and 100 Hz were applied on the mastoid of healthy subjects, patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions, with central lesions of different localizations, and patients with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV). In patients with unilateral peripheral deficit a horizontal nystagmus with a small torsional component beating generally to the not affected side could be observed. This nystagmus did not show adaptation during 40 s. The occurrence was more frequent using 60-Hz stimulations. This vibration-induced nystagmus did never occur in healthy subjects, seldom in patients with central vertigo, and only exceptionally in patients with BPPV.

	<td>In response to loud clicks, a vestibular evoked potential can be recorded from sternocleidomastoid muscles, called "click evoked myogenic potential" (CEMP). This paper reports on the usefulness of CEMP in the differential diagnosis of acute vertigo of presumed vestibular origin. CEMP was examined in 40 patients with acute vertigo of vestibular origin (26 with acute peripheral vestibulopathy, five with Ménière's disease, three with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV), six with psychogenic vertigo) and the results compared with standard caloric reaction (CR). For CEMPs, clicks were delivered unilaterally via a pair of headphones. EMG activity was collected by surface electrodes placed on the sternocleidomastoid belly and averaged. In 29 patients, CR was unilaterally abnormal, pointing to a peripheral vestibular lesion. Seventeen of them had a corresponding loss of CEMPs; the other 12 patients had a normal CEMP. The remaining 11 patients had normal results in both tests. In comparison with CR, CEMP showed a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 100% for peripheral vestibular disorders. CR is a test of the horizontal canal whereas CEMP is thought to be a sacculus test. Different results of CR and CEMP may be due to this difference between target organs stimulated and may be of prognostic value.</td>

Epley's canal repositioning procedure (CRP) was conducted, with appropriate modifications for individual cases, on every patient. Two different types of positional nystagmus were observed corresponding to the presence of otoliths in the lumen of each of the semicircular canals and on the cupola of the horizontal semicircular canal. The posterior canal was involved in 250 patients unilaterally and 23 patients bilaterally. The anterior canal variety was observed in four patients. In the horizontal canal, nine were of the cupulolithiasis and six of the canalithiasis variety. In seven patients. the affected canal converted to a different location. The canal repositioning procedure eliminated vertigo and abnormal eye movements in 88% of the unilateral posterior canal variety. The success rate of the procedure in the other varieties was 50%. Positional vertigo can have characteristics corresponding to the presence of otolith particles in each of the semicircular canals. The treatment requires different strategies to move the otoliths, depending on their location in the vestibule.</td>

In 1644/2186 (75.21%) patients, the type of nystagmus was clinically identified in two opposite directions of gaze in the provocative head position. These patients were divided into two groups: i) idiopathic (n = 1,490) (no apparent cause); ii) post-traumatic (n = 154) (time of onset related to accident). It was found that in the idiopathic group men were older than women; women were more affected than men (2.3:1), and in the post-traumatic group there was no age difference between men and women; women and men were equally affected (1:1). In addition: i) patients were older in the idiopathic than the post-traumatic group. ii) BPPV of the posterior (PSC) was by far more prevalent than BPPV of the horizontal semicircular canal (HSC) in both groups, although there was no difference in prevalence between the two groups. iii) Bilateral involvement was more prevalent in the post-traumatic group. iv) All bilateral cases in both groups suffered from BPPV of the PSC.

	<td>Measurement of ocular counterrolling (OCR) is well known as a simple method to evaluate the peripheral vestibular organ, especially the otolith organ. But it has rarely been used because of the difficulty in differentiating between pathologically reduced OCR and the wide physiological variation of this parameter. In this study, the OCR of 55 patients with unclarified vertigo (n = 20), vestibular neuronitis (n = 15), Menière's disease (n = 10), and benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (n = 10) were evaluated and compared to a control group (n = 30) with the intention of diagnosing peripheral vestibular dysfunction and establishing a differential diagnosis. The test sequence was carried out with Vesta goggles by Panares and included head tilts of 5 degrees, 15 degrees, and 30 degrees to the left and right. The results show a significantly reduced OCR in patients suffering from peripheral vestibular disorders when compared to the control group. There is no specific finding for a specific type of vestibular lesion, but otolith function is affected in several disorders as measured by ocular counterrolling.</td>

	<td>Olfactory dysfunction following trauma has been widely reported and is currently compensable according to existing American Medical Association guidelines when it occurs in the occupational setting. Its presence and the risk factors for its development, however, have not been clearly delineated in occupationally head injured workers. In order to assess this phenomenon, a series of 365 consecutive head injured workers from 1993-1997 was assessed in order to determine the incidence of post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction and its association with the severity of the head injury, the mechanism of injury and other neurotological abnormalities in the same cohort group. Olfactory dysfunction was identified in 13.7% (9.3% with anosmia, 4.4% with hyposmia/dysosmia). It was more likely where the loss of consciousness > 1 h (p < 0.002), in more severe head injuries (grades II-V) (p < 0.001) and when skull fracture (p < 0.001) occurred. The direction of the blow applied to the skull did not influence its presence, although radiologically confirmed skull fractures in the frontal, occipital, skull base and midface were twice as likely as temporal and parietal fractures to result in an olfactory change. From a neurotologic perspective, approximately 21.9% of head injured workers were determined to have recognizable evidence of cochleovestibular dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction as a physical finding post-head injury compares favourably with the presence of post-traumatic benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) and its atypical variants in 11.2% of head injured workers.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the common vestibular disorders. Canalolithiasis is thought to be a likely lesion. A canalith repositioning procedure (CRP by Epley) generally yields good resolution of vertigo and nystagmus. The authors confirmed the efficacy of this procedure on typical BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal type. We designed a new procedure for BPPV of the lateral canal type, which also yielded satisfactory results. BPPV sometimes presents a nystagmus pattern, which suggests multiple lesions. We have seen eight cases of BPPV showing nystagmus that combines both the posterior and the lateral canal types. Combined CRP was performed on these cases, which again gave good clinical results. Other BPPV cases were associated with central lesions. We must be aware that BPPV may involve multiple canals and may be associated with central lesions.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common and treatable causes of vertigo. We examined BPPV types and the effectiveness of physical therapy in each type. BPPV is caused by a utricular statoconium that blocks the semicircular canal. Statoconia can block any of the semicircular canals, but they generally affects the posterior canal. Diagnosis is based on a typical history and characteristic eye movements elicited by the Dix-Hallpike test. Treatment involves a physical maneuver designed to mobilize the free calcium particles from the semicircular canal to the utricle. Canalith repositioning is the mainstay of treatment. The maneuver is illustrated in detail and other forms of treatment and their indications are discussed.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common condition which is usually managed conservatively, surgical intervention being recommended only for those small number of patients in whom it becomes persistent and incapacitating. The results of surgery in 13 patients who underwent posterior semicircular canal occlusion for intractable (> 12 months duration) and incapacitating BPPV are presented with special emphasis on their long-term follow-up. The mean follow-up was 66 months (range, 29-119 months). All patients reported complete and immediate resolution of their positional vertigo, which has been maintained in the long term. Most patients, however, reported some postoperative transient unsteadiness which lasted up to 4 weeks. All patients developed a transient mild conductive hearing loss secondary to a middle ear collection, which usually resolved within 4 weeks. Five patients developed a transient mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss which resolved in all cases within 6 months. There were no reports of sensorineural hearing loss nor tinnitus in the long term. All patients believed that the operation was beneficial and would undergo it again. Our findings indicate that posterior semicircular canal occlusion is an effective and safe operation in the long term and is the procedure of choice for intractable and incapacitating BPPV rather than singular neurectomy.</td>

Retrospective review. A retrospective chart review of 107 patients diagnosed with BPPV at our institution between March of 1993 and June of 1995. Each patient was diagnosed with isolated BPPV by history and Hallpike-Dix maneuver. There were no other vestibular symptoms or electronystagmogram abnormalities. Patients diagnosed with BPPV received modified Epley maneuvers, were instructed to remain upright for 48 hours, and wore a soft collar for a week. Patients were followed up with repeat Hallpike-Dix maneuvers at 1 to 2 weeks. If symptoms persisted, the maneuver was repeated for up to a maximum of three times, at which point patients were considered to have failed treatment. The average age of patients was 57.8 years old. Thirty percent were male and the right ear was affected in 54%. The posterior semicircular canal was affected in 105 ears. The average patient received 1.23 Epley maneuvers, with a success rate of 93.4%. No successfully treated patients received mastoid vibration. Seven out of 107 patients failed after three Epley maneuvers. Two failure patients had a history of temporal bone fracture. Two failure patients were treated with posterior semicircular canal block surgery. The modified Epley maneuver is an excellent treatment for BPPV.</td>

Symptoms subsided within 72 h in 35% and within a week in 74% of patients after one session of treatment. Only two treated patients (6.5%) did not recover versus a 50% failure rate among untreated patients (P = 0.0005).

Treatment outcome was classified as cure (asymptomatic), improvement reduction of symptoms > 50%, or no change. After a single treatment of PRM, complete remission of vertigo and nystagmus were found in 67.7% of the patients and improvement of the symptoms was found in 19.4% of the patients.

A consecutive sample of 100 patients was included in two groups (age-and-sex matched) with a similar number of patients with idiopathic BPPV in each group. Group I was treated using the 'repositioning' maneuver and group II, the 'liberatory' maneuver. At weeks 1, 4, and 12 during the study, the proportion of patients without positional nistagmus was identified, and patients gave an evaluation of their subjective improvement (as a percentage). When positional nystagmus was evident, the corresponding maneuver was used again. Sixty percent of the patients were without nystagmus after the single use of any of the maneuvers. At the end of the study, more than 90% of patients were without nystagmus, with a 90% median value of subjective improvement. Patients with idiopathic BPPV showed a similar response to treatment as patients with BPPV associated to other disorders. We conclude that both maneuvers are effective for the treatment of BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal.</td>

	<td>Particle repositioning procedures such as the Epley manoeuvre have become popular in the management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) at the expense of more traditional therapies such as vestibular habituation. We prospectively analysed the response of consecutive patients presenting with BPPV to treatment with vestibular habituation exercises using a symptom score sheet before and after treatment. This same patient group was then followed up, on average three years, eight months after discharge, to determine their long-term response to treatment. The results of the study demonstrated an excellent short-term response rate to treatment but a high level of recurrence after discharge. Most patients who experienced further symptoms following discharge were however self-reliant and were able to return to their habituation exercises without the need for further medical input. The aim in the management of these patients must be to provide long-term self reliance as well as short-term cure and it may be that this has not yet been well demonstrated with the Epley manoeuvre. It must also be remembered that particle repositioning manoeuvres cannot be used in all patients for example those who suffer with cervical or thoracic spine pathology and that some will fail to respond at all. We believe that vestibular habituation retains a useful role in the treatment of BPPV.</td>

	<td>The current gold standard for diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. However, because of fatigability, the Dix-Hallpike is often falsely normal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of vestibular autorotation testing in the diagnosis of BPPV. The charts of 210 patients at a tertiary referral center for vertiginous disorders were reviewed. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, Dix-Hallpike testing, audiometry, electronystagmography, and vestibular autorotation testing. The vestibular autorotation results of patients with BPPV were compared with the findings in patients with non-BPPV vestibular disorders. The sensitivity and specificity of vestibular autorotation testing in diagnosing BPPV were calculated. Ninety-one patients (42.9%) had BPPV, 76 patients (36.2%) had vertigo of uncertain cause, 28 (13.3%) had unilateral vestibular hypofunction, 9 patients (4.3%) had Meniere's disease, and 2 patients (1.0%) had perilymphatic fistula. Patients with BPPV were 3.32 times more likely to have a normal horizontal gain (95% CI = 1.54-7.19). A normal horizontal gain is 85% sensitive but only 36% specific for BPPV. Patients with BPPV were 1.9 times more likely to have vertical phase lead (95% CI = 0.95-3.93). Patients with BPPV were 2.20 times more likely to have both normal horizontal gain and vertical phase lead (95% CI = 1.03-4.69) The sensitivity of the combination of normal horizontal gain and vertical phase lead on vestibular autorotation testing is 87% specific but only 25% sensitive in the diagnosis of BPPV. A normal horizontal gain or vertical phase lead on vestibular autorotation testing in a vertiginous patient is suggestive of but not exclusive to a diagnosis of BPPV. The combination of a normal horizontal gain and vertical phase lead on vestibular autorotation testing is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of BPPV. Adjuvant use of these parameters in vestibular autorotation testing may prove to be helpful in the diagnosis of BPPV.</td>

Follow-up data were available on all 51 patients. After one manoeuvre, 42 patients had a negative Dix-Hallpike test, and after a second manoeuvre, 8 of the remaining 9 patients had a negative Dix-Hallpike test (testing was conducted 1 to 2 weeks after the PRM was performed). Therefore, the overall short-term success rate after two manoeuvres was 50 of 51 patients (98%), which is similar to other series. A follow-up questionnaire to determine the incidence of recurrence of symptoms was administered after a minimum period of 30 weeks. Twenty-three patients reported a recurrence (or, in the case of the one treatment failure, persistence) of their symptoms (45%). Therefore, although virtually all patients can be treated successfully with the PRM, almost half of these patients can be expected to experience a further recurrence of symptoms. This long-term recurrence rate is higher than has previously been reported and is a significant factor clinicians must be aware of in their treatment of this condition. In particular, this finding emphasizes the need for patient counselling with regard to the likelihood of recurrence and access to follow-up treatment if recurrence occurs.</td>

This paper demonstrates that a new scale of self-perceived disablement in the vestibularly impaired population-the Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL)-differentiates between disabled and healthy persons and evaluates the associations of this assessment with other measures of vestibular disorders. Prospective. Subjects were 1) asymptomatic, healthy adults, 2) patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 3) patients with chronic vestibulopathy excluding Meniere's disease, postsurgical vertigo, and postconcussion vertigo, and 4) family members. Patient were assessed on the VADL, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, level of vertigo, and computerized dynamic posturography. Healthy subjects and family members completed the VADL. The VADL differentiates healthy persons from patients but does not differentiate between patient groups. Patients perceived themselves as more independent than their spouses perceived them to be. Scores are weakly correlated with vertigo frequency and posturography scores for conditions with unreliable kinesthesia and absent or unreliable vision. The VADL is more responsive to higher levels of impairment than the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. This well-normed, self-administered scale of self-perceived disablement is useful for evaluating the functional status of patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. Perceptions of patients and significant others vary, but scores are moderately correlated with some standard measures of vestibular function. As it assesses a different domain of function than do standard diagnostic tests, the VADL will augment these tests during initial evaluation and may be useful for assessing posttreatment change.</td>

Patients diagnosed as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and patients diagnosed as having chronic vestibulopathy, excluding Ménière disease, postsurgical vertigo, and postconcussion vertigo. The final scale has 3 subscales: functional, ambulation, and instrumental. It has good face validity, high internal consistency (alpha> or =.90), and high test-retest reliability (r(c)> or =0.87). Scale ratings ranged from 1 (independent) to 10 (ceasing to participate in the activity), but median scores for most subjects were 4 or less.

This law is clinically useful in diagnosing pathology of the vestibular end-organ, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or the superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.</td>

	<td>The canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM), as defined by Epley, can be an effective treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The staff at Başkent University's Ear Nose and Throat Clinic performed CRM on 68 cases of canalithiasis in 64 BPPV patients from June 1996 to August 1997. Symptoms resolved after the first session in 49 patients (72%) and after the second session in 11 cases (16.2%). It was necessary to repeat the maneuver three times in two cases (2.9%) and four times in one patient (1.5%). Discounting three patients who were lost to follow-up, only two patients in our study did not respond to CRM treatment. There was no co-existing pathology found in all but two of the patients studied. Our experience indicates that unless there is no response to CRM or there is suspicion of an incorrect diagnosis, it is not necessary to perform diagnostic studies routinely for differentiating other neuro-otologic disorders prior to using CRM in BPPV patients diagnosed by the Dix-Hallpike test.</td>

	<td>Sixteen patients affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the horizontal semicircular canal (BPPV-HSC) were investigated by means of dynamic posturography (DP) and during bithermal caloric stimulation. Data were compared to data from 40 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal (BPPV-PSC) and 20 healthy controls. No postural deficit was observed before or after a liberative Lempert's manoeuvre when patients were compared to control subjects. BPPV-PSC postural scores were significantly impaired compared to scores from the BPPV-HSC group. A residual significant postural impairment was also observed after a successful liberative manoeuvre in the BPPV-PSC group. Electronystagmographic recordings before recovery revealed significant hypoexcitability of the affected ear in 8/16 patients of the BPPV-HSC group. After the liberative manoeuvre, a symmetric bilateral response to caloric stimulation was recorded in all patients. Three main conclusions can be drawn from the present data. First, disorders of the horizontal semicircular canal do not change postural control. Second, dynamic posturography can detect the postural imbalance due to posterior semicircular canal dysfunction even after resolution of paroxysmal vertigo attacks. Third, utricular dysfunction can be ruled out as a cause of the residual postural deficit observed in BPPV-PSC patients. Therefore the recovery delay observed even 1 month after the liberative manoeuvre in the BPPV-PSC-group might be due to the persistence of small amounts of residual debris in the canal, to paralysis of ampullar receptors, or to the time needed for central vestibular re-adaptation.</td>

	<td>To correlate patient response and recurrence rate after canalith repositioning to clinical presentation and cause of BPPV. This was a retrospective chart review. This study was performed at a tertiary referral center. The study included patients with a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo based on history and the presence of a positive response to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (affected ear down) who were treated at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences between January 1993 and February 1997 using canalith repositioning. There were 52 patients (13 men, 39 women) with an average age of 63 years. Canalith repositioning was performed without the use of vibration, with the maneuver repeated up to three times as necessary at the initial session until vertigo and nystagmus were abolished. Initial response, defined as complete response (elimination of nystagmus and symptoms), improved response (elimination of nystagmus but with some residual symptoms), or no response (continued nystagmus and symptoms), as well as recurrence rate. Initial complete response was seen in 66% of patients, and 33% showed improved response. This difference was believed to be caused by the pathophysiology. Recurrence rates appeared to be correlated to cause, with higher rates reflecting ongoing inner ear injury, such as with Meniere disease. Canalith repositioning was effective in 99% of patients based on elimination of nystagmus. Partial responders probably experienced resolution naturally over time because of a difference in pathophysiology. Higher recurrence rates can be expected when the cause is thought to involve an ongoing process.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common but often unrecognized cause of treatable vertigo. Possible causes of misdiagnosis of BPPV were studied by review of the records of 191 patients referred to our neurology clinic; 36 were identified as having BPPV not previously diagnosed. On referral the patients carried the following diagnoses: unspecified dizziness/vertigo (33%), transient ischemic attacks (28%), cervicogenic vertigo (19%), psychogenic dizziness/vertigo (11%), and others (8%). The paroxysmal nature of the vertigo and position-precipitating factors were not spontaneously reported by 31%. Atypical, even bizarre, symptoms including dizzy sensations were reported by 19%, and neck pain and headache were cardinal symptoms that accompanied vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which is essential for the diagnosis of BPPV, was not performed in any of the patients prior to referral. 30 (83%) experienced complete resolution of signs and symptoms after the first physical treatment session. We conclude that non-paroxysmal, non-positional vertigo does not rule out BPPV. Atypical and even bizarre complaints of dizziness, as well as neck pain and headache could be cardinal symptoms of BPPV. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is mandatory in those complaining of dizziness and vertigo.</td>

Meniere's symptoms preceded the onset of BPPV in all of our patients. Seven of the 9 patients were female. Except for one patient who experienced BPPV bilaterally, BPPV was limited to the same ear as the Meniere's disease. All patients presented with intractable BPPV that did not respond completely to otolith repositioning procedures. A detailed description of five patients is presented. Our data, in conjunction with that of others, suggest that Meniere's disease may predispose patients to intractable BPPV.

	<td>To determine whether, in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the canalith repositioning procedure performed with vibration applied over the mastoid bone of the affected ear is more effective in resolving the symptoms and preventing recurrence of BPPV than the procedure performed without vibration. Retrospective case review. Tertiary referral center. Ninety-four patients diagnosed as having BPPV involving the posterior semicircular canal. Patients were assigned to one of 2 treatment groups: the canalith repositioning procedure with vibration (n=44) and with no vibration (n=50). Effectiveness of treatment was determined through clinical reevaluation or reported through a telephone interview 1 week after treatment. Intensity of symptoms was quantified on a scale of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, or severe); effectiveness of treatment was categorized on a scale of 1 to 4 (cure, much better, better, or no change). Rate of recurrence was determined through later clinical reevaluation or a telephone interview. At 1 week, 57 of the 94 patients were cured and 16 were much better, providing a 78% overall success rate. There was no significant difference in effectiveness of the treatment or the frequency of reoccurrence of BPPV between the vibration and no-vibration groups as determined from the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and log-rank test. Rate of recurrence was 47% at a maximum follow-up of 5.25 years. Our results suggest that, while the canalith repositioning procedure is effective in the treatment of BPPV, vibration applied during the maneuver does not significantly affect short-term or long-term outcomes.</td>

	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) originating from the posterior semicircular canal (pSCC) is a common vestibular disorder that is easy to diagnose and usually easy to treat. The majority of patients with BPPV have no known inner ear disease; they have "primary" or "idiopathic" BPPV. However, a minority does have objective evidence of an inner ear disease on the same side as the BPPV and this group has "secondary" or "symptomatic" BPPV. Previous publications differ on the prevalence of secondary BPPV and about the types of inner ear diseases capable of causing it. In order to determine what proportion of patients have secondary as opposed to primary BPPV and which inner ear diseases are capable of causing secondary BPPV, we searched our database for the 10-year period from 1988 to 1997 and found a total of 2847 patients with BPPV. Of these, 81 (3%) had definite pSCC-BPPV secondary to an ipsilateral inner ear disease. Sixteen had Menière's disease, 24 had an acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy, 12 had a chronic unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy, 21 had chronic bilateral peripheral vestibulopathy and 8 had unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. It seems that any inner ear disease that detaches otoconia and yet does not totally destroy pSCC function can cause BPPV and that a case can be made for audiometry and caloric testing in all patients with BPPV.</td>

The patient complained of a vertigo and was diagnosed as having a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Upon neurological examination, he was completely free from neurological deficits. MR angiogram revealed an occlusion of both ICAs. On conventional angiogram, the right ICA was occluded about 3 cm distal from its origin, and the left ICA was occluded at the precavernous portion. There was an abundant collateral blood flow to the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes through the posterior communicating arteries. Both carotid canals were hypoplastic on 3D-CT. The patient was then diagnosed as having a hypoplasia of both ICAs. Using a positron emission tomography (PET), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and vascular transit time (VTT) were measured during resting state, and the vascular reactivities to carbon dioxide inhalation (VRCO2), and to the intravenous administration of Acetazolamide (VRACZ) were also evaluated. There was no global or focal reduction in CBF and VTT was within normal limit, whereas a global reduction of CMRO2 caused mild decrease in OEF. Moreover, VRACZ was significantly decreased and an intracerebral steal phenomenon was observed in the parietal cortical areas, whereas VRCO2 was preserved. The discrepancy between VRACZ and VRCO2 observed could be related to the differences in the mechanisms underlying the vasodilating effects of carbon dioxide and ACZ.</td>

Its diagnostic effectiveness on the first visit was analyzed and key signs and symptoms with high predictive value for common causes of vertigo were identified. One hundred outpatients who complained of dizziness or loss of balance were evaluated using a structured clinical interview. Each questionnaire was examined independently by three blinded investigators, who assigned a diagnosis and identified the elements of the history that figured most prominently in the diagnosis. The gold standard was defined as independent selection of the same diagnostic category by all three investigators. A first-visit diagnosis was obtained in 40% of patients (95% confidence interval 30-50%): 38% women and 42% men. Causes included benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV, 13 patients), headache-associated vertigo (9), Meniere disease (7), cervical vertigo (3), psychiatric dizziness (2), post-traumatic vertigo (2), vertebro-basilar transient ischemic attack (1), vestibular neuritis (1), convulsive seizure (1), and presyncope (1). The best predictors of BPPV were the precipitating mechanism (specificity [SP] 100%), positional nystagmus (sensitivity [SE] 90%, SP 63%), and the Dix-Hallpike test (SE 82%, SP 71%). Elements predictive of headache-associated vertigo were duration of the attack (minutes) and a personal history of headache (both, SP 100%).

Retrospective review of patients at a tertiary vestibular rehabilitation center. Variables identified for statistical analysis included method of diagnosis, age, sex, onset association with trauma, semicircular canal involvement, presence of bilateral disease, treatment visits, and cycles of canalith repositioning maneuvers per treatment visit. Multivariate statistical analysis using Pearson chi2, likelihood ratio, linear-by-linear association, and cross-tabulation tests were performed. Two hundred fifty-nine patients with BPPV who received treatment were identified from 1996 to 1998. Average follow-up time was 16.9 months. 74.8% required one treatment visit, 19.0% required a second treatment visit, and 98.4% were successfully treated after three treatment visits. The remainder required up to seven treatment visits for relief of symptoms. Variables affecting the number of treatment visits included bilateral disease or location of disease other than in the posterior semicircular canal. Patient age, sex, method of diagnosis, and onset association with trauma had no statistically significant impact. Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo not located in a single posterior semicircular canal are more likely to require multiple visits for canalith repositioning.</td>

	<td>Paroxysmal vertigo, permanent vertigo, positional and postural vertigo, and transient vertigo are special forms, which are differentiated by their temporal course. Paroxysmal vertigo, together with hearing impairment and noises in the ear, is typical of Menière's disease. Persistent vertigo often occurs after the loss of a peripheral vestibular end organ (e.g. after trauma of infection). In the case of positional and postural vertigo, a differentiation must be made between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo due to "wandering" otoliths, and orthostatic vertigo, which occurs on changing rapidly from a lying to a sitting position. The diagnosis is verified by Epley or Semont positional maneuvers. Confirmation of a cervical vertigo is provided by the de Kleijn and Nieuwenhuyse test. Brief episodes of vertigo (transient vertigo) occur after transient ischemia, for example when craning to look at a high building. In the acute stage, treatment of vestibular vertigo consists in the damping of the threshold for vestibular stimuli with antiemetics. For long-term treatment, antihistaminics and histamine-like substances have proven of value.</td>

	<td>Migraine in childhood is relatively common disease. Although clinical practice and scientific publications recognize frequent association of migraine and vestibular disorders, relationships have yet to be well defined. In present study the vestibular function was extensively tested in 20 children suffering from migraine. All the patients underwent complete neurootological examination including tonal threshold audiometry, testing of vestibulo-spinal reflexes--Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda tests, Dix-Halpike test for BPPV, videonystagmography. On videonystagmography each patient was evaluated regarding: calibration, spontaneous nystagmus, gaze nystagmus, eye tracking test, optokinetic and positional nystagmus, and caloric testing. The same procedure have been performed regarding control group comprised of 15 healthy. All the patients with migraine presented abnormalities in vestibular testing. Analysis of the results showed that: functional state of structures forming both visuo-ocular and vestibulo-ocular structures was altered in all the migraine patients evaluated in the study, pathological findings suggest mainly central localisation of vestibular dysfunction in children suffering from migraine, the number of pathological VNG findings seems not to be correlated with the type of migraine.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a labyrinthine disorder with a typical behavior: intense crises of rotational vertigo induced by postural changes of the head, with short duration and usually good responsiveness to rehabilitative maneuvers. This phenomenon is thought to be subsequent to the movement of floating particles in the labyrinthine fluids, which can provoke gravitational stimulations. In order to conduct a metabolic and autoimmune examination, 70 patients affected by BPPV were examined. In 34 cases (48.5%) autoimmune alterations were found: in 19 cases (27.1%) the level of anti-thyroid antibodies far exceeded the normal values with a significant incidence in comparison with a control group (P<0.01). No other 'risk factors' were present. It can be hypothesized that the diffusion of immune-complexes in the inner ear could change the composition of the endolymphatic fluid exerting a mechanical stimulation of the receptors and provoking the typical vertigo.</td>

	<td>The liberatory maneuver of Semont is an effective physical treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It works because it causes otoconia to move out the posterior canal. The effectiveness of the maneuver is thought to be indicated by the appearance of a liberatory nystagmus. After the maneuver, patients are usually instructed to keep their heads erect for several days and not to lie on the pathologic side for about a week. Here we investigated the prognostic value of liberatory nystagmus and whether restrictions are necessary after treatment. Fifty-six patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo underwent the Semont maneuver and were checked after 20 minutes, 24 hours, and 1 week. The patients were told that they could sleep or move as they pleased, without any particular precautions. We found that liberatory nystagmus had a high prognostic value and that it was not necessary for patients to avoid certain positions or movements after treatment.</td>

Dizziness was found in 61% of patients, whereas balance disorders were found in 77% of patients. Nine percent were found to have unrecognized BPPV. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of a spinning sensation and the absence of a lightheadedness sensation predicted the presence of unrecognized BPPV. Patients with unrecognized BPPV were more likely to have reduced activities of daily living scores, to have sustained a fall in the previous 3 months, and to have depression. These data indicate that unrecognized BPPV is common within the elderly population and has associated morbidity. Further prospective studies are warranted.</td>

One hundred twenty-two cases were evaluated. Electronystagmographic evaluation, including caloric testing; audiometric tests; and medical records. Caloric weakness was demonstrated in 58% of patients on the involved side and in 19% on the normal side. Complete paralysis was found in 7%. Directional preponderance was seen in 33% of patients and completely normal scores in 27%. During the course of the disease, responses become weaker in 26% of patients and stronger in 11%. Of 39 patients tested more than twice, 26% showed both increases and decreases in caloric responses. After an acute attack, only one of eight patients showed a depressed response on the diseased side, and three showed an increased response. Spontaneous nystagmus, seen within 24 hours of an attack in 54 cases, was directed away from the diseased ear in only about one half of the cases. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was found in 44% of these patients. Possible pathophysiologic explanations for the various test results in Ménière's disease are discussed. Interpretation of caloric test results should take into account the absolute value of the slow phase eye speed scores, in addition to the right-left difference score. Also, established standards for the normal range of fluctuation in both absolute and comparative scores should be used when more than one test session has been undertaken.</td>

	<td>Many patients suffering from vertigo have no neurological symptoms except for a positional nystagmus. Vertigo without any neurological findings has not been thought to be a vertebrobasilar (VB) attack. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between vertigo without any neurological symptoms and the VB system using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MRAs of the VB system were examined in 31 patients with positional nystagmus of unknown origin (PNU) and in 14 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) as control. MRA was performed with a 1.5-tesla system using the two-dimensional time-of-flight technique. Abnormalities such as elongation, bending, narrowing or obstruction of the artery were detected in 27 patients of the PNU group and 8 patients of the BPPV group. A significant difference in the abnormalities was noticed between the two groups (p < 0.05; chi(2) test). This result is almost similar to those of previous studies using conventional vertebral angiography and digital subtraction angiography. Thus, MRA is useful in examination of the VB system. Moreover, our study suggested that the positional nystagmus might result from VB ischemia, even if there were no other neurological signs.</td>

Ten cases improved with labyrinthine suppressants and habituation exercises alone. This included all the patients wherein the Dix-Hallpike maneouvre did not elicit any nystagmus. However, in the group wherein the Dix-Hallpike maneouvre resulted in nystagmus, only one of the four improved and the particle repositioning maneouvre (PRM) was employed in the three cases with persistent symptoms. Two had immediate relief of symptoms. The particle repositioning maneouvre was repeated after three days in the one other patient and proved successful on this second occasion. Surgical treatment was not necessitated in any case, It is proposed that the particle repositioning maneouvre should be the preferred first-line treatment for any patient who on Dix-Hallpike testing demonstrates nystagmus typical of BPPV.</td>

Treatment of patients with our maneuver, which, in comparison with traditional repositioning maneuvers, was modified by breaking the procedure up into seven positions and rotating patients by 360 degrees along their longitudinal axis, gives a higher, but not statistically significant, number of treatment successes (84.5%) than the traditional Parnes maneuver (60%) (P = .154); treatment of a third group of patients with our modified particle repositioning maneuver with the addition of head-shaking on reaching each single position gives a higher (95.6%), statistically significant number of treatment successes than traditional Parnes maneuver (P = .00011). The success rates achieved from modified particle repositioning maneuvers are statistically significant. Onset or persistence of dizziness, which patients frequently complain of after liberatory maneuvers, affects only 5.6% of the patients treated.

To compare the efficacy of the Semont maneuver (SM), the VRE and the combination of both in the treatment of BPPV at three months of follow up. Forty patients with the clinical and electronystagmographic diagnosis of BPPV were divided into three groups: 1. SM, 2. VRE and 3. SM + VRE. The results were compared in regard to the signs and symptoms observed in the three groups of patients at 15 days, one month and at three months of treatment. The SM was effective in 80% of the patients at 15 days of treatment versus 45% of those receiving only VRE. The third group of patients, receiving the combined treatment, demonstrated a cure in 100% of the cases when evaluated at three months while only 66% of the SM group were found to be asymptomatic at the same time period (p < 0.05). The SM is easy to perform, rapid and effective in the short term, however has high recurrence. The VRE are effective in the long term based on the patient persistence.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo. The diagnosis is confirmed by observing a classical response during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The cause of BPPV is usually idiopathic. There are two popular hypotheses described regarding the pathogenesis of BPPV. The first one is the "cupulolithiasis" hypothesis, and the second hypothesis, the so-called "canalithiasis" hypothesis. The clinical course of BPPV is spontaneous recovery in weeks or months. Treatments for BPPV have ranged from no intervention to surgical treatment. The new treatment, "Canalith-repositioning procedure (CRP)" which was introduced by Epley in 1992 produces a very high rate of success. This treatment has caused interest and has been modified and studied worldwide in recent years. To study the efficacy of the canalith-repositioning procedure that we modified from Epley's maneuver in the treatment of BPPV patients. A descriptive study. The BPPV patients, who came to the neurotologic clinic at Srinagarind Hospital from January 1997 to December 1998, were treated with our technique that was modified from Epley's maneuver. We neither used pre-medication, a mastoid oscillator, nor post-treatment instruction. The total number of patients included in this study was 19. The efficacy of this procedure for curing nystagmus and vertigo was 89.5 per cent. One patient did not follow-up and one patient did not respond to the CRP. Complication such as vago-vagal reflex, lateral canalithiasis, occurred in 5.3 per cent of the patients. The recurrence of BPPV in our study was 26.3 per cent. However, CRP was also effective in treatment of both patients with recurrence as well as those without recurrence. The canalith-repositioning procedure that is modified from Epley is effective in the treatment of BPPV.</td>

It continues to support this procedure as the treatment of choice for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). All 44 operated ears were relieved of BPPV, with one patient having an atypical late recurrence. Of the 40 ears with normal preoperative hearing, one had a delayed (3-month) sudden and permanent profound loss, while one other had a mild (20 dB) loss. Six patients had protracted courses of imbalance and motion sensitivity. Canal plugging has led to several new and innovative developments including the partial labyrinthectomy for difficult-to-access skull base lesions and superior semicircular canal plugging for dehiscence. These new procedures and their development are reviewed in this paper.</td>

	<td>Equilibrium disorders caused by involvement of brainstem and cerebellar structures are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but peripheral conditions such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can be sometimes confused with those of a central origin. Therefore, an accurate otoneurologic investigation paying attention to differential diagnosis aspects should be performed in these subjects. Among available diagnostic tools, electro-oculography, posturography and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) are especially suited to assess vestibulo-oculomotor and vestibulospinal systems. This paper briefly describes the most recent otoneurologic diagnostic strategies for MS patients and the results of initial clinical experiences, and finally provides suggestions for differentiating MS-related vestibular disorders from other common otoneurological conditions.</td>

	<td>Reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the vestibular ganglion (VG) is the suspected cause of vestibular neuritis (VN). Recent studies reported the presence of HSV-1 DNA not only in human VGs but also in vestibular nuclei, a finding that indicates the possibility of viral migration to the human vestibular labyrinth. Distribution of HSV-1 DNA was determined in geniculate ganglia, VGs, semicircular canals, and macula organs of 21 randomly obtained human temporal bones by nested PCR. Viral DNA was detected in 48% of the labyrinths, 62% of the VGs, and 57% of the geniculate ganglia. The potential significance of this finding is twofold: (1) Inflammation in VN could also involve the labyrinth and thereby cause acute unilateral vestibular deafferentation. (2) As benign paroxysmal positional vertigo often occurs in patients who have had VN, it could also be a sequel of viral labyrinthitis.</td>

	<td>To determine the incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) following stapedectomy in a patient group and the efficacy of the Epley maneuver in this group. Prospective study in a university-based tertiary referral system. The patient group comprised 63 patients who had undergone stapedectomy; a control group consisted of normal healthy individuals with no otolaryngological complaints. All individuals underwent the Dix-Hallpike maneuver for the diagnosis of BPPV. Patients who exhibited vertigo, torsional nystagmus (which reverses its direction on return to sitting position) preceded by a latent period, and the fatigability of these findings were considered to have BPPV. If the test result was positive, they underwent the Epley therapeutic maneuver. Four of the patients who had undergone a stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV. No individual in the control group had BPPV. All patients responded well to the Epley maneuver. Stapedectomy may be regarded as an etiological factor in BPPV. Because the fenestra is located in the posterior part of the stapes footplate, the pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular rather than saccular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy. An Internet survey of the relevant literature in English shows a scarcity of publications on the incidence of BPPV following stapedectomy. In the present study, 63 patients who had undergone a stapedectomy were investigated for the presence of BPPV; all had Dix-Hallpike maneuvers performed for the diagnosis. Sixty-three individuals with no otolaryngological complaints made up the control group. Four of the patients who had undergone stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV, and no individual in the control group had BPPV; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. All four of the patients diagnosed with BPPV responded well to the Epley maneuver. The pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy.</td>

	<td>Some time has passed since the early 1980's when a group of vestibologists with the same singular passion introduced in Italy the concept of Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (PPV). Since then great advances have been made, but, despite the energy focused on improving and expanding the knowledge on this common disorder, PPV still frequently goes unrecognized. The direct consequence of delayed diagnosis is prolonged patient discomfort and the execution of useless, costly clinical examinations. Today, in most cases, delayed diagnosis is unjustified. Within the modern concept of health care economics, such delay is costly to the health care provider and has obvious psycho-physical repercussions for the patient who has to undergo a fruitless series of examinations and treatments of all types without reaping any benefits. In this light the Authors have performed a study to identify and quantify the relative costs of the most common errors made in the diagnosis of PPV. For a sample population of 100 patients, the clinical-instrumental tests performed before the disorder was correctly diagnosed were gathered and analyzed. Then the costs for the management of PPV patients diagnosed late were compared with those for patients whose diagnosis was reached early on. The results indicate that for each delay in PPV diagnosis the average cost was Euro 317.66 vs. Euro 64.04 for early diagnosis: a difference of Euro 253.06. The Authors underline how in this brief period of time (March-September 2000) the prescription of excessive testing led to a significant waste of money (Euro 10137.01).</td>

Each form requires a different treatment strategy of head maneuvers and application of other modalities to restore normal semicircular function and thereby eliminate the positional nystagmus and vertigo.

Following this observation and using the same maneuver, we examined two groups of patients. The first group included 86 patients with continuous tinnitus, or tinnitus in specific head/body positions. whose origination was associated with recent vestibular symptomatology. The second group included 100 patients with positional tinnitus, but without any vestibular disorder. Ages ranged between 35 and 78 years and gender distribution was 114 females and 72 males. It was shown that 29 patients in the first group (33.2%) and 18 patients in the second group (18%) could be released from their tinnitus. Eleven patients in the first group (12.7%) and 7 patients in the second group (7%) noticed a reduction of their tinnitus.

	<td>A quantitative study of the stimuli and vestibulo-ocular response associated with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was made to test and further develop the canalithiasis theory of BPPV. The angular velocities of the head in the planes of the semicircular canals during the Dix-Hallpike test were measured in four healthy subjects using electromagnetic sensors to record the position of the head in a six degrees of freedom paradigm. Next, the nystagmus reactions in seven patients diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV were recorded with video-oculography. The characteristics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) response were analyzed using three-dimensional vector techniques. The angular velocity of the head was primarily, but not exclusively, in the plane of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) in question. Both the anterior and horizontal canals were also stimulated by a lesser degree. The duration of the motion stimulus in the PSC was < 1.3 s with peak angular velocities of 150 deg/s. The eye response in BPPV patients began 4 s after the test and had a duration of 15-20 s. Peak slow-component eye velocities of about 42 deg/s were reached 3-5 s after onset of nystagmus. The motion of the eye, as predicted by the cupulolithiasis theory, is disconjugated and has torsional, vertical, and horizontal components. In the eye ipsilateral to the tested ear it is primarily torsional (0.80, 0.54, 0.16) and in the contralateral eye it is mainly vertical (0.57, 0.73, 0.08). These results suggest that particles, initially resting on the floor of the cupula dome in the PSC, are perturbed by the Dix-Hallpike test and disperse freely into the endolymph where they are propelled by gravity into the canal lumen. This creates abnormal pressure on the cupula and the specific VOR activation of the ipsilateral superior oblique and the contralateral inferior rectus muscles, whose force vectors are indistinguishable from the measured eye motion vectors. The estimated pressure exerted on the crista is approximately 10(-2) dyn/cm2.</td>

	<td>A pendular rotation test in a head-tilted position (60 degrees backwards and rotated 45 degrees to either the right or left) was performed in 7 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Patients were rotated 360 degrees at a frequency of 0.1 Hz (maximum speed 114 degrees/s). The excitability of vertical semicircular canals was evaluated using this test procedure. Using an infrared CCD camera and a PC, evoked nystagmus was analyzed in order to determine the morbidity of BPPV. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was found in the maximal slow-phase eye velocity between nystagmus from the anterior semicircular canal and nystagmus from the posterior semicircular canal. The excitability of the posterior semicircular canal in the affected ear was lower than that of the anterior semicircular canal. However, when vertigo and nystagmus disappeared, the difference in excitability was improved. The present results indicate some functional deterioration of the posterior semicircular canal in BPPV cases, suggesting the participation of both mechanical (dumping by mass) and organic (peripheral end organ) factors in causing morbidity.</td>

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the treatment by Epley maneuver on short-term BPPV-related quality of life. Forty-two individuals with BPPV were included: 39 with posterior canal affected, 2 with the lateral canal and one with the anterior canal. Diagnosis was established if a consistent clinical history was found and Dix-Hallpike test (DHT) in cases with canal posterior involvement. Subjects with positive DHT were treated by a single Epley maneuver and were recommended to avoid supine for the next 48 hours. The BPPV relapses were investigated at 7th and 30th day post-treatment. BPPV-associated quality of life was evaluated by the Dizzness Handicap Inventory Short-form (DHI-S) at days 1st and 30th post-treatment. Total and partial scores for emotional, physical and functional subscales were compared by Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Dix-Hallpike test was found positive in el 59% individuals (23/39), and 41% cases did not required any treatment. Among 23 patients treated with Epley maneuver, DHT was found negative in 90% at 30th day follow-up. Mean and standard deviation of the total scores obtained in the DHI-S at the first day were 19.22 +/- 9.66 in the DHT positive-patients and 19.79 +/- 10.14 in the whole group (DHT positive or negative). These scores significantly decreased to 10.84 +/- 10.99 at 30 days post-treatment (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the DHI-S is a specific health questionnaire able to assess BPPV-related health and the effectiveness of treatment.</td>

The basic strategy of the CRP was to rotate the involved canal slowly in the plane of gravity so that free-floating materials could migrate into the utricle only once. After the procedure we instructed patients to keep their heads upright for 10 h and not to sleep on the affected ear for 2 weeks. After the initial treatment, successful results were obtained in 51 of the 62 patients (82.2%). After the second treatment, 56 patients (90.3%) experienced success. Six patients (9.7%) did not obtain resolution even after the second treatment. While 46 patients were diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV, in 16 patients a different diagnosis was determined (head injury in 7 patients, Ménière's disease in 2, vestibular neuritis in 2 and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in 5). We categorized these 16 patients as having secondary BPPV. Patients with idiopathic BPPV showed a significantly higher success rate with CRP than those with secondary BPPV. Patients with secondary BPPV may have quantitatively or qualitatively different lesions than those with idiopathic BPPV.</td>

	<td>The pathogenesis and epidemiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are still not well defined. Treatment protocols have emerged along with complementary hypotheses regarding pathogenesis. Ultrastructural studies suggest a multistep process of otoconia metabolism responsible for forming the otolith membrane. A defect in otoconia metabolism leads to an excess of otoconia within the utricular sac (utriculolithiasis). Gravitational forces cause the entrapment of otoconia within the semicircular canal system (canalolithiasis). Localization of these otoconia within the semicircular canal system is deducted by combining the gravitational orientation of the canal involved with the vestibular neurophysiology of the resulting nystagmus recorded during testing and throughout treatment. New terminology is required to differentiate short-arm from long-arm canalolithiasis. Evidence from digital videonystagmography recordings of nystagmus is coupled with principles of gravitational fluid mechanics to explain the mechanisms of disease development and treatment. These observations lead to important questions that define future directions in research.</td>

	<td>The majority of episodes of sudden hearing loss are caused by inner ear disorders, often accompanied by vertigo. The patterns of hearing loss usually influence the prognosis. The purpose of this study was to analyze vestibular diagnoses in sudden hearing loss with vertigo, and to correlate them with the recovery of hearing loss. The clinical records of 125 patients with sudden hearing loss were reviewed. Various vestibular evaluations were performed in 36 patients with vertigo. The vertigo in these patients was classified as normal, unilateral hypofunction, directional preponderance, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), non-specific or irritative. The initial and final pure-tone audiograms of these patients were compared. The distribution of vestibular diagnoses was unilateral hypofunction in 30.6% of patients, BPPV in 25.7%, normal in 19.4%, non-specific in 11.1%, directional preponderance in 8.3% and irritative in 8.3%. The recovery of hearing in patients with vertigo was significantly worse than in those without vertigo. The recovery of hearing in patients with spinning vertigo did not differ from that of patients with non-spinning vertigo. The recovery of hearing was worst in the BPPV group, especially in the high frequency range, followed by the unilateral hypofunction group, who showed hearing thresholds between those in the BPPV group and those in the normal vestibular function test group. This study suggests that the diagnostic classification of vestibulopathy is a useful prognostic indicator of hearing recovery in sudden hearing loss with vertigo. We conclude that otolithic and semicircular canal involvement may cause poor hearing results, especially in the high frequency range.</td>

BPPV may be idiopathic or secondary to head traumas, viral labyrinthitis, otology surgery and many others conditions. We report two cases of BPPV secondary to surgical maneuvers on superior maxillary. We have not found this etiology in scientific literature but, the increase of this kind of surgery, can produce an increase of its frequency. For this reason the otoneurologists and oral surgeons must bear in mind this possibility to make a right diagnostic and treatment of the syndrome.</td>

The walk-rotate-walk (WRW) test, developed by one of us (T.R.) and described in the text, was applied to all patients. The immediate good treatment results with Lempert's maneuver verify the correct diagnosis of BPPV-HC. The WRW test is a more sensitive test for BPPV-HC than earlier positional tests. The unhabituated acute phase of vestibular neuritis shows positive test results and must be eliminated with caloric tests. The WRW test identifies as a dynamic test patients with symptoms of even lesser magnitude, where the compensatory capacity of the equilibrium system suppresses the diagnostic findings with earlier positional horizontal canal tests.</td>

	<td>Histologic sections of the human temporal bone display snapshots of the entire lifetime integrated into the moment the bone enters fixative. The bulk of the literature on vestibular histopathology is anecdotal and descriptive in nature, rather than quantitative. This is because the means of describing and measuring patients' vestibular symptoms are poorly developed, and the complex geometry of the vestibular labyrinth complicates efforts to study it in serial histologic sections. Histopathologic findings in the common peripheral vestibulopathies, including Meniere's syndrome, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, viral labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, and ototoxicity, have all been described. A new quantitative method for assessment of vestibular otopathology using Nomarski optics has recently been reported. It has been successfully applied to create a normative database of age-related changes in the vestibular hair cell populations which, in turn, has been used to study the effects of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and Meniere's syndrome. These data provide the first meaningful opportunity to make structure-function correlations between vestibular function testing and temporal bone pathology in humans. Wider clinical application of vestibular function testing and postmortem temporal bone donation should be promoted by all investigators interested in accumulating the resources necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the human vestibular system in health and disease.</td>

	<td>The stabilometry signals involve irregular and unpredictable components. In order to identify the hidden dynamics that underlie the multi-link networks consisted of the multiple sensory systems, motor components and central integration, we applied a nonlinear analysis to these signals. We evaluated the postural control differences between eyes open and closed by means of the dynamical closeness between two states, known as similarity index, for the patients with vestibular disorders. We were able to demonstrate that some patients (eight of 21) showed a difference between the conventional and nonlinear measures. Especially, the similarity index tended to reflect the clinical course of the vestibular compensation and the findings in the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) demonstrated that its vestibular function may include various pathologies besides canalithiasis. These results suggest that nonlinear analysis can elucidate the complex postural control networks and this procedure may also be able to provide the new findings of the stabilometry examinations.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a most common cause of dizziness and usually a self-limited disease, although a small percentage of patients suffer from a permanent form and do not respond to any treatment. This persistent form of BPPV is thought to have a different underlying pathophysiology than the generally accepted canalolithiasis theory. We investigated 5 patients who did not respond to physical treatment, presented with an atypical concomitant nystagmus or both with high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear. This method provides an excellent imaging of the inner ear fluid spaces. In all 5 patients, we found structural changes such as fractures or filling defects in the semicircular canals which we did not find in control groups. One patient clinically presented with the symptoms of a 'heavy cupula'. Whereas crosssections through the ampullary region and the adjoining utricle showed no abnormalities, there were significant structural changes in the semicircular canals, which are able to provide an explanation for the symptoms of a heavy cupula.</td>

A randomized prospective study of patients with BPPV. Seventy-one patients were randomized to one of three groups at their first clinic visit. These groups included the PRM, a sham PRM, and a control group. Patients were followed up in clinic at 2 weeks and 3 months. The mean long-term follow-up was 12 months. A telephone questionnaire was also conducted. At 2-week follow-up, 81.8% of patients in the PRM group had a resolution of symptoms and a negative Dix-Hallpike test compared with 15.3% in the sham PRM group and 60% in the control group. This difference was statistically significant between the treatment (PRM) and sham PRM groups and between the sham and control groups. It nearly reached significance between the treatment and control groups (p = .06). The sham treatment group had by far the worst outcome at the 2-week interval. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups after 2 weeks. The PRM is side specific. It may help induce remission of the vertiginous symptoms of BPPV in the short term. This cannot be attributable to a placebo effect. The PRM does not seem to affect the natural history of the disorder in the long term. The sham treatment causes a delay in spontaneous recovery, possibly by preventing the particles from falling into the utricle. This study has not compared the frequency or severity of symptoms.</td>

A total of 106 BPPV patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups, and responses were evaluated one week, one month and three months after the initial treatment. At the one-week follow-up, similar cure rates were obtained with the Semont and Epley maneuver (74% and 71% respectively), both cure rates being significantly higher than that obtained with Brandt &amp; Daroff exercises (24%). By the three-month follow-up, the cure rate obtained with the Epley maneuver was higher (93%) than that obtained with the Semont maneuver (77%), though both remained higher than that obtained with the Brandt &amp; Daroff maneuver (62%). However, the proportion of initially responding patients showing subsequent relapse was lower among patients treated by the Semont maneuver than among patients treated by the Epley maneuver.

A retrospective chart review of 344 cases of vertigo identified 19 cases with headaches characteristic of migraine as per strictly defined criteria (International Headache Society, 1988). Four distinct types of vertiginous syndromes were noted. The commonest syndrome (Group I) manifested transient episodes of imbalance with additional momentary subjective rotary vertigo worsened by movement. The attacks lasted a few hours and evaluation in the inter-episode interval demonstrated no vestibular deficit. Group II manifested transient objective rotatory vertigo of from 10 minutes to a few hours but no demonstrable permanent vestibular deficit. Group III displayed symptoms and signs characteristic of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Group IV manifested a permanent unilateral labyrinthine weakness. Causation of vertigo by migraine was implied in 10 of 19 cases where the headache and vertigo occurred simultaneously and in two other cases where the vertigo improved with anti-migraine prophylactic treatment. Four distinct and characteristic vertigo syndromes have been noted with migraine. Their spectrum ranges from a transient reversible dysfunction to a more permanent destruction, and includes involvement of both the peripheral and the central vestibular systems.</td>

	<td>The inner ear, one of the most complex organs, contains within its bony shell three sensory systems, the evolutionary oldest gravity receptor system, the three semicircular canals for the detection of angular acceleration, and the auditory system--unrivaled in sensitivity and frequency discrimination. All three systems are susceptible to a host of afflictions affecting the quality of life for all of us. In the first part of this review we present an introduction to the milestones of inner ear research to pave the way for understanding the complexities of a proteomics approach to the ear. Minute sensory structures, surrounded by large fluid spaces and a hard bony shell, pose extreme challenges to the ear researcher. In spite of these obstacles, a powerful preparatory technique was developed, whereby precisely defined microscopic tissue elements can be isolated and analyzed, while maintaining the biochemical state representative of the in vivo conditions. The second part consists of a discussion of proteomics as a tool in the elucidation of basic and pathologic mechanisms, diagnosis of disease, as well as treatment. Examples are the organ of Corti proteins OCP1 and OCP2, oncomodulin, a highly specific calcium-binding protein, and several disease entities, Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and perilymphatic fistula.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common and most treatable cause of vertigo. In most cases, a simple maneuver that takes less than a few minutes to do resolves the problem. BPPV is caused by misplaced calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) in the semicircular canal of the inner ear that have broken free from the utricle. When these crystals break free, they either remain loose in one of three different semicircular canals or attach to the hair cells within a canal. Several different types of treatment maneuvers have been described. The maneuver to use varies according to the semicircular canal involved and whether the crystals are loose or attached to the hair cells.</td>

The frequency of diagnosis of these cases was divided almost equally into 5 groups: (1) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) 23%; (2) suspected BPPV, 18%; (3) peripheral vestibular disorders other than BPPV, 22%; (4) disorders other than peripheral origin, 18%; and (5) undiagnosed, 19%. Based on our results, BPPV, other peripheral vestibular disorders, and disorders of other origins should be differentiated from the first screening. BPPV was most frequent and diagnosed by typical positioning nystagmus. Many other peripheral vestibular disorders were accompanied by nystagmus. It is also important to differentiate serious illnesses such as cerebrovascular disease (7%), space-occupying lesions in the posterior fossa (1.2%), and cardio-circulatory disease (3.6%).</td>

	<td>Our understanding of the pathomechanism of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has improved dramatically. A type of BPPV featuring mixed torsional and vertical nystagmus induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver involves the posterior semicircular canal (P-BPPV). The other type of BPPV featuring horizontal nystagmus induced by spine-to-lateral head positioning involves the horizontal canal BPPV (H-BPPV). In complaints of vertigo or dizziness, 619 patients visited our department last year. Of these, 142 (23%) was had positional nystagmus consistent with a diagnosis of BPPV, 118 (19%) had no nystagmus but were suspected of BPPV due to vertigo episodes. BPPV was the most frequent diagnosis. H-BPPV was not rare, but accounted for 30% of BPPV. Of H-BPPV, 73% featured direction changing geotropic nystagmus, and 27% direction changing apogeotropic nystagmus. H-BPPV resolved faster than P-BPPV. Most cases caused by head trauma were P-BPPV. Transition between P- and H-BPPV was found in 6 cases. Women outnumbered men by about 3 to 2 in both P- and H-BPPV. Peak incidence was found in the those in their 60s and 70s, suggesting that the etiologies of both types of BPPV are essentially the same.</td>

Medical records from nine patients with HC-BPPV, treated between July 1996 and March 2000, were retrospectively analyzed. Data of complete history, audiograms, positional tests and neuro-otological examinations were collected. All patients were treated with a particle repositioning maneuver called the "barbecue rotation" which starts with the patient in the supine position and consists of three 90-degree head rotations towards the unaffected ear. HC-BPPV was characterized by brief attacks of intense vertigo that were induced mainly by rolling over in bed (9/9) and turning the head to either side while upright (5/9). In most cases, rotation to the pathological side from supine position caused a very intense horizontal nystagmus beating towards the undermost ear. Findings such as latency and fatigability, which are common features of posterior-canal BPPV (PC-BPPV), were not present. After the barbecue rotation, all patients had immediate and sustained relief of their attacks during the 4 to 15 months' follow up. HC-BPPV is different from PC-BPPV and other vertiginous diseases in typical presentations and positional testing results. The barbecue rotation is a successful method for curing the disorder.</td>

In seven patients with HC-BPPV, the velocity vectors were well aligned with the axes of the HC and in four patients they were not. In addition, the 3D velocity vectors of the slow phase of pressure nystagmus in all 11 subjects with HC fistula were closely aligned with the axes of the HC. The pathology of HC-BPPV in most patients with apogeotropic positional nystagmus has been considered to be localized in the HC. However, our results strongly suggest that the pathology of HC-BPPV with geotropic nystagmus is localized in the utricle.

Although relatively rare, BPPV has been reported to occur in children. The goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of cupular deposits in pediatric material. Basic science, two-center histopathologic temporal bone study. We examined 186 temporal bones from 121 individuals between the ages of newborn and 10 years. The average age was 14.7 months. All temporal bones were acquired at autopsy, embedded in celloidin, and sectioned for light microscopic study. The cupulae of the semicircular ducts were identified and any deposits found were graded according to their size and position on the cupula. A total of 276 cupulae were identified, and in 35 (12.7%) of these a basophilic deposit was found. In many cases the deposits contained recognizable otoconial crystals. Most deposits were small and they were almost equally distributed between the three semicircular ducts. However, the lateral and posterior cupulae were somewhat more involved than the superior cupula. Our data showed that cupular deposits are less frequently found in the pediatric labyrinth, compared with adults as reported in previous studies. The lower occurrence in children versus adults suggests that the deposits may be a phenomenon of the aging vestibular labyrinth.</td>

	<td>To review the clinical features of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the horizontal canal (HC-BPPV). Retrospective study (September 1999 to March 2001) of 25 patients with HC-BPPV. Patients complained of positional vertigo associated with direction changing horizontal positional nystagmus, either geotropic or ageotropic. The horizontal nystagmus was triggered in all patients when rolled to either side in a supine position (head raised 30 degrees) and in 14 patients by the Dix Hallpike manoeuvre. The nystagmus was geotropic in 15 patients and ageotropic in 10. It varies in time in 4 patients with one change in 3 (from geotropic to ageotropic in 2 and ageotropic to geotropic in 1) and 4 changes in 10 days in another patient. In one patient with head trauma, the HC-BPPV was currently associated with ipsilateral posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC-BPPV), and its characteristic rotatory-up beat nystagmus. Interestingly, 4 patients had a previous history of ipsilateral PC-BPPV and in 5 others an ipsilateral PC-BPPV occurred after the HC-BPPV. Although spontaneous recovery of HC-BPPV was common in most patients, a 270 degrees "barbecue rotation" or a "prolonged position on the healthy side" was effective in some patients. Patients with positional vertigo should undergo Dix Hallpike positioning and supine lateral head turns as this latter manoeuvre is more efficient to diagnose an HC-BPPV. Both the transformation of the positional horizontal nystagmus (geotropic-ageotropic) and the association with a PC-BPPV support the diagnosis of an HC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>To clarify the clinical significance of positional down beat nystagmus (pDBN). A discussion of the neuro-otological findings in 50 consecutive patients with pDBN. In 38 patients there was evidence of CNS disease (central group) but in 12 there was not (idiopathic group). In the CNS group, presenting symptoms were gait, speech, and autonomic dysfunction whereas in the idiopathic group patients mostly reported positional vertigo. The main neurological and oculomotor signs in the CNS group were explained by cerebellar dysfunction, including 13 patients with multiple system atrophy. In patients with multiple system atrophy with a prominent extrapyramidal component, the presence of pDBN was helpful in the differential diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism. No patient with pDBN had the Arnold-Chiari malformation, a common cause of constant down beat nystagmus (DBN). In the idiopathic group, the pDBN had characteristics which suggested a peripheral labyrinthine disorder: vertigo, adaptation, and habituation. In six patients an additional torsional component was found (concurrently with the pDBN in three). Features unusual for peripheral disorder were: bilateral positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre in nine of 12 patients and selective provocation by the straight head-hanging manoeuvre in two. It is argued that some patients with idiopathic pDBN have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with lithiasis of the anterior canal. The torsional component may be weak, because of the predominantly sagittal orientation of the anterior canal, and may not be readily seen clinically. Nystagmus provocation by bilateral Dix-Hallpike and straight head-hanging may be explained by the vertical upwards orientation of the ampullary segment of the anterior canal in the normal upright head position. Such orientation makes right-left specificity with the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre less important than for posterior canal BPPV. This orientation requires a further downwards movement of the head, often achieved with the straight head-hanging position, to provoke migration of the canaliths. The straight head-hanging manoeuvre should be carried out in all patients with a history of positional vertigo and a negative Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder which can be simply diagnosed. The evolution of highly effective positioning maneuvers has made BPPV the most successfully treatable cause of vertigo. We evaluated patients with BPPV with regard to past medical history and disease-related diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Forty-two patients were recruited from a specialised dizziness clinic, and a further 29 patients were recruited from a neurological practice. The mean duration of the disease was 3.2 years, with an average of 2.4 episodes lasting typically several weeks to months. More than half of the patients felt severely disabled by BPPV. On average, three different medical specialities were consulted. Cerebral imaging (42%), caloric testing (46%), and audiometry (49%) were performed more often than diagnostic positioning (28%). Most patients received ineffective or no therapy, and only 4% were treated with a specific therapeutic positioning maneuver. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a long-lasting and frequently recurrent disease which leads to significant morbidity and medical costs. The recent progress in the diagnosis and therapy of BPPV has not yet been widely established in medical practice in Germany.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequently occurring dizzy syndrome. The literature provides ample descriptions of the forms determined by canalo/cupulolithiasis of the posterior canal, the most common, as well as canalo/cupulolithiasis of the horizontal canal. Descriptions of the forms of canalo/cupulolithiasis of the anterior canal are, instead, very rare and, sometimes questioned: this is fundamentally due to its superior position, which makes it a much less likely site for the accumulation of debris, both from a conceptual and practical point of view. For these reasons, the Authors feel that the presentation of this case of PPV is of particular interest. After analyzing and excluding other interpretations as less probable, they considered the syndrome as determined by the association of right posterior and anterior canalolithiasis. This form, as in the case of posterior canalolithiasis, responded to treatment with Semont's liberatory procedure.</td>

	<td>To determine the effect on hearing and balance symptoms following singular neurectomy (SN) for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the ampullary recess of the posterior semicircular canal. The charts of 242 patients with chronic disabling BPPV who were treated with SN over a 29-year period (1972-2001) were reviewed. The results on relief of BPPV and hearing function were recorded. A subset of 16 patients where the posterior ampullary recess was entered to expose the SN is described in detail with regard to an effect on hearing and balance. A total of 252 SN were performed in 242 patients. Ten patients underwent bilateral SN sequentially; the remaining 232 patients had unilateral SN. The ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 86 years, with a mean at 57 years. The female:male ratio was 174:68. Complete relief of BPPV was achieved in 244 patients (96.8%), incomplete relief in 3 (1%), and no relief in 5 (2%). Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurred in 9 patients (3.7%). A subset of 16 patients in whom the ampullary recess was opened during SN ranged in age from 21 to 79 years, with a mean at 56 years. The female:male ratio was 12:4, with right and left sides divided almost equally. Relief of BPPV was achieved in all 16 patients with no loss of hearing function. Five patients complained of a fistula response postoperatively (31%). The fistula response resolved by 6 months postoperatively in all 5 patients. SN is effective in relief of BPPV with little risk of SNHL (3.7%). The risk of SNHL is not increased when the posterior ampullary recess must be entered in order to transect the singular nerve. A positive fistula response may be present temporarily in almost one third of these patients.</td>

	<td>We present temporal bone and clinical evidence that common syndromes of recurrent vertigo are caused by a viral infection of the vestibular ganglion. In the present series, histopathologic and radiologic changes in the vestibular ganglion and meatal ganglion were consistent with a viral inflammation of ganglion cells in cases of Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and vestibular neuronitis. Clinical observations of multiple neuropathies involving cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII on the same side in patients with recurrent vertigo are best explained by a cranial polyganglionitis caused by a neurotrophic virus, which is reactivated by a stressful event later in life. The reactivation of the latent virus may manifest as one of the above vertigo syndromes, depending on the part of the vestibular ganglion that is inflamed, the type and strain of the virus, and host resistance.</td>

	<td>Some new modificutiont of existing diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres (repositioning of particles) have been proposed, basing an the applications of the principles of hydrodynamics, inertial and gravitational forces in the semicircular canals. The above has been tried successfully on patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and horizontal eanal paroxysmal positional vertigo (HCPPV) which can be executed by the patients themselves at home without the kelp of a therapist.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a well-established entity whereas Horizontal Canal Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (HCPPV) is a recently proposed one. In positional vertigo any canal may be involved. It is quite possible that in the past this diagnosis (HCPPV) was missed in many of the cases of positional vertigo. Kapfschuttel nystagmus (head-shaking nystanmas) is induced by side to side (to and fro) movements of the head around a vertical axis in the plane of the horizontal semicircular canal which is thought to be sensitise the labyrinth, Any manoeuvres that in induce nystagmus with or without vertino is hound to he a manifestation of an organic lesion and not a non-organic one. In a number of instances the postionul test Jor BPPV may yield negative results; but doing this test after kopfschuttel test a dormant positional nystagmus may appear on the surface i.e. uncovered in a number of cases which may have remained undetected if Kopfschutlel manoeuvre were not done. This implies- that by Kopfsi huttel test both the horizontal and vertical canals are sensitised.Moreover, Kopfschuttel nystaagmus is likely to be a manifestation of the horizontal canal stimulation, at leastin some cases, since the movements are executed in the plane of the horizontal canal (vide infra) when displaced otoconia impinges on the cupula /. crista bringing about its stimulation leading to vertigo and or nystagmus.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which patients suffer from acute rotatory vertigo due to the presence of free otoconial debris migrating into one or more semicircular canals during head movements and resulting in abnormal stimulation of the ampullary crest. A prolonged loss of equilibrium of unclear origin is also present. Static posturography is a useful tool for the study of postural control systems and their role in these abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of body sway and long-term instability of BPPV patients by posturography frequency analysis. Twenty patients with canalithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal and 20 normal controls were subjected to static posturography. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Patients were tested 1 h after diagnosis, and 3 days and 12 weeks after the characteristic Epley repositioning maneuver. Patients with BPPV showed significantly increased body sway both on lateral (X) and anteroposterior (Y) planes compared to normal subjects. Corporal oscillation with a broad-frequency spectrum was observed in both closed and open eye tests. The repositioning maneuver decreased the X plane body sway, while the anteroposterior sway was unchanged. Twelve weeks after treatment, a normalization of the anteroposterior sway was observed. Results of this study suggest that the long-term postural disturbance associated with BPPV differs from the acute disequilibrium that subsides after canalith repositioning: the former is a sagittal plane/broad spectrum body sway, while the latter is primarily a frontal plane/low frequency sway. The Epley maneuver was shown to reduce frontal sway, a postural abnormality that might therefore be linked to posterior semicircular canal function. Conversely, the observed sagittal body sway was only partially relieved by the restoration of canal function, and therefore, may be more related to the chronic dizziness observed in these patients.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a disorder of the inner ear causing brief attacks of intense rotatory vertigo and nystagmus occurring shortly after certain well-defined head movements. The present review discusses treatment of this disease in relation to new knowledge about its epidemiology and pathogenesis. A review is given based on our experience and a Medline search of relevant literature published over the last ten years. The disorder is common; prevalence increases with age. There is now general agreement that the symptoms are caused by loose particles in the endolymph of the inner ear. Treatment by repositioning manoeuvres has proven effective. Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is safe, effective, and inexpensive. It should start at the time of diagnosis. Management of typical cases should be feasible in a general practice setting.</td>

	<td>Although head trauma is the cause of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) in about 15% of cases, the clinical features and response to treatment in this particular group of patients was not previously evaluated. We present 20 cases of traumatic BPPV: 12 cases identified from 150 consecutive BPPV patients diagnosed in our Dizziness Clinic; and 8 cases diagnosed from 75 consecutive head trauma patients seen in the Emergency Room. In all patients the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and all were treated by the Epley procedure. Treatment results were compared to those of 40 consecutive patients with idiopathic BPPV. There was a wide spectrum and severity of head trauma including road accident (7), different falls (5), blow to the head (5) and miscellaneous (3). Two patients experienced brief loss of consciousness. Only two patients were diagnosed as BPPV before referral to our clinic. When presented to our Dizziness Clinic the patients were diagnosed as follows: unspecified dizziness (7), cervical vertigo (4) and transient ischemic attack (1). Five patients (25%) had bilateral BPPV. Eight patients (40%) had complete resolution of symptoms and signs following a single treatment while 12 patients (60%) required additional physical treatments until complete resolution of BPPV was achieved. During follow-up, 11 patients (55%) had recurrent attacks of BPPV. Thirty-four patients with idiopathic BPPV (85%) had a single successful treatment session while the others required repeated physical treatments until complete resolution of BPPV. We conclude that traumatic BPPV is probably under-recognized or misdiagnosed in clinical practice. Response to a single physical treatment seems to be less favorable than in idiopathic BPPV. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is mandatory in all patients with dizziness and vertigo following head trauma.</td>

Recurrent vestibulopathy like Menière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, were not included. Patients were evaluated initially and 6 months after pharmacological and/or rehabilitation therapy. At the initial assessment, the head-shaking test was specific for the side of the lesion in both groups, even if spontaneous nystagmus was no longer present. Thus, head-shaking nystagmus is a physical sign that can be easily evoked and gives useful information about the presence of vestibulo-ocular reflex asymmetry. At the follow-up at 6 months, many changes in the head-shaking nystagmus were noted: in some cases it appeared, in some others it changed direction and more often it disappeared. There is actually no acceptable explanation for the disappearance of the head-shaking nystagmus, despite some evidence that vestibular compensation could play a role. It is definitely proved that sensitivity of the head-shaking test is really poor, especially in the course of time and, therefore, it should not be used alone in the follow-up of patients with vestibular disease.</td>

	<td>Nystagmus is a rhythmical rotation of the eyeball. Its characteristics can be defined mathematically by the axis of rotation and the angular velocity around this axis. We analysed the axis of rotation for the nystagmus in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to elucidate its pathophysiology. Thirteen patients with typical unilateral BPPV participated in the present study. The axis of rotation for the nystagmus was calculated from images recorded on digital videotape with an infrared CCD camera, using an algorithm that we developed. The patients' responsiveness to Semont's liberatory maneuver was also assessed.The results showed that patients could be assigned to one of two groups based on the rotation axis of the nystagmus. In one group of patients (n = 7; Group A), the axis of rotation was almost vertical to the plane containing the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) on the presumed affected side. In the other group of patients (n = 6; Group B), it was clustered around the naso-occipital axis. These results suggest that in the patients in Group A the responsible lesion is confined to the PSC, whereas the pathogenesis underlying the conditions in those in Group B is considered to be more complicated. This speculation was reinforced by the difference in responsiveness to Semont's liveratory maneuver. All of the patients in Group A showed remission of vertigo within 10 days (mean, 2.4 days) after onset of treatment using Semont's liberatory maneuver, whereas the patients in Group B required much longer periods of time for remission to occur (mean, 25.7 days). Our findings lead to the conclusion that by considering the spatial orientation of individual semicircular canals, in the patients in Group B the pathophysiology is not confined to the PSC, but most probably all three semicircular canals are involved.</td>

Retrospective chart review. One hundred sixty-two patients with positional vertigo during Dix- Hallpike positioning were identified. Patients were evaluated for the presence or absence of nystagmus. All patients underwent the Semont liberatory maneuver. The patient's condition at follow-up was documented at 3 weeks as complete, partial, or failure. Repeated procedures were performed if necessary. There were 127 cases of objective BPPV and 35 cases of subjective BPPV. Overall, 90% of all patients tested had significant improvement of their vertigo after 1.49 maneuvers on average. Improvement was seen in 91% of patients with objective BPPV after 1.59 maneuvers on average, compared with 86% in subjective BPPV after 1.13 maneuvers on average (chi2 test, not significant [P = .5]). Patients with a history of traumatic origin or cause had an overall success rate of 81% compared with 92% for nontraumatic causes or origins (chi2 test, not significant [P = .1]). Recurrences were seen in 29% of patients after a successful initial maneuver; however, 96% of these patients responded to further maneuvers. Four patients with persistent symptoms after conservative management underwent posterior semicircular canal occlusion with resolution of symptoms. The Semont liberatory maneuver provides relief of vertigo in patients with positional vertigo, even in patients without objective nystagmus.</td>

To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2001), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1974 onwards), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was June 2001. Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: - Epley manoeuvre versus placebo. - Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls. Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment. Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a "positive" Dix-Hallpike test to a "negative" Dix-Hallpike test Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Eleven trials were identified but nine studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving two trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. Both studies included in the review (Lynn 1995, Froehling 2000) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls.

	<td>We report a case of atypical cerebral venous drainage in a 38-year-old woman with symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus was suspected on the basis of spin-echo and time-of-flight MR findings, but multisection CT angiograms showed a patent sigmoid sinus and predominant drainage via the emissary veins toward the vertebral plexus, with only a minor contribution of the jugular veins. This case illustrates the variability of the venous anatomy in the craniocervical region.</td>

	<td>We have developed a new technique for analyzing the rotation vector of eye movement with an infrared CCD camera [Imai et al.: Acta Otolaryngol 1999;119:24-28]. We used this technique to analyze the eye rotation axis of benign paroxysmal positioning nystagmus (BPPN) that was induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver in 14 patients with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV). Eye rotation axes of BPPN in 8 patients were closely perpendicular to the posterior canal of the undermost ear in the provocative head position. Under the hypothesis that BPPN is due to a mechanical stimulation of the posterior canal by canalolithiasis, this finding suggested that the posterior canal of the undermost ear is the lesion. On the other hand, eye rotation axes of BPPN in the other 6 patients were closely aligned with the naso-occipital axis. It is suggested that canalolithiasis induces endolymphatic flow in both posterior and anterior canals via the common crus and the summation of the eye movements induced by stimulation of both the posterior and anterior canals rotates the eye along the naso-occipital axis.</td>

A retrospective review of the records of patients with BPPV. Neurotology clinic of the ear, nose, and throat department of a general hospital. One hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study, 54 male and 68 female, mean ages 61.8 and 59.6 years, respectively, ranging in age from 25 years to 86 years and with symptoms lasting for an average of 124 days. The diagnosis of each type of BPPV was based on the history of the patients and on the positive results of the appropriate provoking maneuver. From all the patients, a comprehensive history was obtained, followed by clinical examination of the ears, nose, and throat and a complete audiologic and neurotologic examination, including electronystagmography. All patients were treated with an appropriate repositioning maneuver, depending on the type of BPPV. Of 122 patients, 110 had posterior canal involvement, 10 had horizontal canal involvement, and only 2 had the anterior canal variant. The canalith repositioning procedure was immediately successful in 106 patients and in 8 more patients proved successful after its repetition in a second session, resulting in a total success rate of 93.4%. All the BPPV variants shared the same clinical and demographic characteristics and responded equally well to treatment. However, differential diagnosis was necessary to apply the appropriate canalith repositioning procedure. Although data from clinical and histologic studies do not fully account for the observed relative occurrence of each variant of BPPV, a satisfactory explanation may be provided by the anatomic location of each semicircular canal and additionally by self-treatment of most cases of the horizontal and the anterior canal variety.</td>

	<td>To determine if position during bedrest is related to the canal affected in posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Fifty-five individuals with posterior canal BPPV were investigated. Diagnosis was established if a consistent clinical history was found with vertigo and induced positional nystagmus elicited on the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT). Preference for left or right position during bed rest was determined before performing the DHT. All patients were treated by a single particle repositioning procedure, and relapses were investigated at the seventh and 30 days posttreatment. Forty-five individuals always slept on the same side (29 on the right, 16 on the left side), and 10 patients preferred to change sides during bed rest. Among those patients able to maintain a constant position during bed rest, 27 and 18 presented a positive DHT on the right and left sides, respectively. The canal affected was found to be significantly associated with side during bed rest (relative risk = 2.75; P = 0.01, Fisher exact test). DHT was negative in 86% of patients at 30 days. No differences were found between individuals who presented a constant position in bed and those who changed positions. Lateral supine position during bed rest is associated with the canal affected in BPPV. We speculate that gravity might facilitate the deposition of particulate material on the posterior semicircular near the ampulla canal during bed rest.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent labyrinthopathy in humans. Treatment consists mainly of liberatory maneuvers aiming to remove otolithic debris and subsequent postural restrictions in order to prevent debris from returning into the canal. The reappearance of symptoms after an effective liberatory maneuver was studied in a group subjected to restrictions and in a second group free from restrictions. The effects of these restrictions were evaluated. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups. Accordingly, restrictions seem to have no effect upon symptom recurrence. The slight supremacy of the Semont maneuver and the prevalence of subsequent relapse compared with the Epley maneuver suggests that these maneuvers could operate on different disorders (cupulolithiasis versus canalolithiasis). Finally, late recognition of relapse in patients who undergo restrictions might even make the liberatory maneuver less effective.</td>

	<td>It has been postulated that bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) may be the result of an ongoing autoimmune process against the inner ear and a pattern of progressive bilateral SNHL linked to an autoimmune inner ear disorder has been reported. Various attempts have been made to develop an assay to confirm the diagnosis of autoimmune inner ear disease. In this study we used a Western blot assay to determine the presence of IgG antibodies directed against a PO antigen (30 kDa) of the guinea pig in the sera of patients affected by sudden loss of vestibular function (SLVF). Ten patients affected by vestibular neuritis were enrolled: eight with unilateral vestibular loss and two with sequential bilateral impairment. We also tested nine patients with sudden unilateral hearing loss, five with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and six normal subjects. In the present study only one patient, a woman affected by bilateral vestibular impairment, had IgG antibodies against the PO protein. Our results indicate either that the antigen PO is not a valid marker for autoimmune unilateral SLVF or that our patients did not have an immunological basis for their disease. However, we can suggest that bilateral impairment of vestibular function and bilateral progressive SNHL are more likely to be immune-mediated disorders and that PO could be a valid marker for these diseases. As bilateral vestibular neuritis is an uncommon disease, a multicentre study is required to confirm our suggestions.</td>

A complete otoneurologic bedside examination of each patient, including assessment of positional nystagmus, was performed at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up. Nine of 90 patients with Ménière's disease also had BPPV, which manifested in different ways. In 3 patients, BPPV preceded the onset of Ménière's symptomatology in the same ear; in 1, BPPV manifested after treatment for Meniere's disease had ended and the patient was in complete control of the spontaneous spells of vertigo; in 5 cases, recurrences of both Meniere's disease and the positioning symptomatology coincided. Treatment for each condition was conducted independently and favorable results were obtained after long-term follow-up when Meniere's disease and BPPV did not coincide simultaneously. In the group manifesting symptoms of both disorders at the same time, gentamycin treatment with the Canalith Repositioning Procedure and/or Semont maneuver partially resolved the symptoms. In the context of Ménière's disease, the sequence of appearance of BPPV relative to the spontaneous episodes must be taken into account when planning the treatment for each of the disorders, which should be considered independently.

An open, retrospective, record-based study. Specialized outpatient dizziness clinic. We reviewed 58 unselected patients with a Dix-Hallpike test demonstrating positioning nystagmus characteristic of BPPV, who were treated during the past 4 years with the particle repositioning maneuver. Before treatment, all patients underwent detailed clinical and laboratory neurotological testing. The treatment outcome was assessed with regard to persistence of symptoms and the presence of positioning nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike testing. Seventy-eight percent of patients with BPPV no longer demonstrated characteristic positional nystagmus after 1 particle repositioning maneuver compared with 71% of patients with BPPV+ (p = 0.56) who did, whereas 13% of the BPPV and 14% of the BPPV+ group required more than 1 treatment to be rendered nystagmus negative on Dix-Hallpike testing (p = 0.89). However, 14% of patients with BPPV remained dizzy, compared with 63% patients from the BPPV+ group, despite a negative Dix-Hallpike test after treatment (p = 0.0018). Patients with horizontal canal paresis (n = 15) had a better outcome than patients with central vestibular dysfunction (n = 7, p = 0.006). Etiologic factors seemed to affect outcome-patients with idiopathic BPPV and those with a preceding acute vestibular neuronitis had a tendency for a better outcome than BPPV patients with any other etiology (p = 0.058). Our study demonstrates that patients with BPPV+ do not have a worse prognosis with respect to resolution of positional nystagmus, on performing the particle repositioning procedure, compared with patients with uncomplicated BPPV. However, they do suffer incomplete resolution of symptoms because of a coincidental anterior or horizontal canal dysfunction and otolithic or central vestibular dysfunction. It appears that the majority of patients with BPPV+ need further vestibular rehabilitation after the particle repositioning maneuver.</td>

Recurrence of BPPV after occlusion surgery of the posterior semicircular canal has not previously been reported in the literature, to the authors' knowledge. Failure of occlusion not only permits the continued symptoms of BPPV but also burdens the patient with the additional morbidity of a fistula of the PSCC. The authors describe the successful treatment of a patient with recurrent and incapacitating BPPV after the failure of occlusion surgery of the posterior semicircular canal, when the patient was simultaneously crippled by the distressing morbidity of an iatrogenic fistula. Case report. Tertiary care referral center. Surgical excision of the fistulous segment of the membranous posterior semicircular canal. The BPPV was resolved. The distressing symptom of a fistula was eliminated. Hearing was preserved. Failure to completely occlude the posterior semicircular canal during posterior canal occlusion surgery results in recurrence of BPPV and an iatrogenic fistula, both of which are preventable. The occurrence of such an event is described, its management is outlined, and some thoughts are offered about its prevention.</td>

	<td>We report a 44-year-old man who had apogeotropic nystagmus with the rotation of his head to either side from the supine position. His nystagmus lasted more than 2 minutes and was difficult to treat with. There were no neurological abnormalities except for the nystagmus and no findings suggesting intracranial disease on MRI. The head-position in which more intense nystagmus was evoked changed again and again in a short term. We diagnosed his illness as cupulolithiasis of horizontal canal, however, the affected ear could not be explained by any of the previously supposed mechanisms. In our case, we speculate the following mechanism. Otoliths were located on the right utricular side of the cupula. All of them were attached on the cupula at the beginning(attached phase) and then, some of them were detached from it(detached phase). The extent of the cupular deviation differed in each phase when the otoliths were beneath the cupula with his head turned to the left lateral position. According to Ewald's second law, more intense nystagmus is evoked when the cupula deviates toward the utricle than away from it. The patient's head-position in which more intense nystagmus was evoked changed according to the balance between the effect of Ewald's second law and the amount of otoliths detached from cupula. Our case showed that, in HC-BPPV with direction-changing apogeotropic nystagmus, we could not be certain about which ear was diseased. Therefore, it may be difficult to apply exercise therapy by determining the affected ear based on the head-position in which more intense nystagmus is evoked.</td>

	<td>Aim of the work was to describe a new physical therapeutic approach for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo determined by canalolithiasis of the lateral semicircular canal. A review is made of the literature, and personal experience is reported. A total of 55 cases were observed, 40 geotropic forms, 15 apogeotropic forms. Liberatory manoeuvres were carried out observing the nystagmus during videonystagmoscopic examination, thus attempting to solve the problem in the first treatment session. Monitoring the patient under videonystagmoscopic examination, progression of the otolithic mass towards the non-ampullary segment is documented by the appearance of a nystagmus directed towards the healthy side (and, therefore, inhibitory, due to ampullofugal deflection of the ampullary cupula) during the individual steps of the rehabilitation treatment. Of the 40 geotropic forms, 30 were successfully treated with the Vannucchi-Asprella technique, and the other 10 with the Vannucchi-Asprella manoeuvre followed by a Lempert barbecue rotation. Of the 15 apogeotropic forms, 6 were solved with the Vannucchi-Asprella manoeuvre, 2 with the Vannucchi-Asprella technique followed by Lempert, 6 with the inverted Gufoni technique, followed by Lempert, 1 transformed into geotropic with inverted Gufoni plus Lempert and then resolved by means of a Vannucchi-Asprella manoeuvre. In all cases, therapeutic success was achieved in the first session. Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the lateral semicircular canal does not allow every case to be fully solved at the first attempt with any technique proposed up to now, in particular, for the apogeotropic forms. Being aware of the different techniques, choosing that most appropriate for the patient's "physical" needs, and, above all, verifying under videonystagmoscopic examination the progression in an ampullofugal direction of the otolithic mass during treatment enable excellent therapeutic results to be obtained in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the lateral semicircular canal, by modifying the rehabilitation strategy while it is being carried out. Videonystagmoscopic examination monitoring of the nystagmus during treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the lateral semicircular canal, is taking the place of the rigid schematism of the manoeuvres proposed, so far, allowing the treatment programme to be adapted to the individual case, thus enabling a solution to be reached in the first rehabilitation session by means of tailored therapy.</td>

This canal is exclusively connected, via the brainstem, to the external and internal oculomotor muscles so that the movement obtained by its stimulation can only be horizontal! This is quite different from what is obtained for the posterior canal, which is connected to various oculomotor muscles. Specific therapeutic maneuvers have to be carried out to be efficient: if properly performed, the otoconias, heavy particles sensitive to gravity, are easily mobilized. This paper describes the pathophysiology of the positional vertigo of the horizontal canal, diagnosis of its two presentations, and therapeutic possibilities.</td>

	<td>If Semont's liberating manoeuvre does not lead to relief of symptoms in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of posterior semicircular canal after the first session, it can be repeated once again, in refractory cases, whilst symptomatic patients after second manoeuvre require rehabilitation therapy Repeating Semont's manoeuvre several times has proven to progressively increase the percentage of cured patients or it may convert posterior semicircular canal forms to typical incomplete or lateral semicircular canal forms, hence requiring other manoeuvres to achieve vertigo resolution. Aim of study was to assess the effect of liberating manoeuvres repeated up to 4 times and to establish possible passages from one canal to the other during manoeuvres as well as percentage of cases refractory to this therapy, who would then need rehabilitation. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was diagnosed in 448 cases of whom 344 (76.8%) of the posterior semicircular canal, 20 (0.45%) the incomplete form of the posterior semicircular canal, 20 (0.45%) subjective positional vertigo and 74 of the lateral semicircular canal (4.2%). Right side was affected in 58.4% of cases, left in 34.5%, and bilateral in 7.1%. All 344 patients underwent Semont's liberating manoeuvre (1st manoeuvre) with first control after 48 hours: if symptoms (typical, atypical nystagmus or paroxysmal vertigo evoked by Dix-Hallpike's manoeuvre) persisted, Semont's liberating manoeuvre was repeated (2nd manoeuvre). In presence of lateral semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo conversion, Lempert's manoeuvre was performed instead. Second control was performed after 48 hours and in cases of persistent typical, atypical or lateral semicircular canal nystagmus 3rd manoeuvre was performed. After further 48 hours, third control was carried out: symptomatic patients with typical forms were submitted to 4th manoeuvre, while typical incomplete forms or forms of the lateral semicircular canal underwent Lempert's manoeuvre. In conclusion, symptoms disappeared after 1st manoeuvre in 61.6% of cases; further manoeuvres, carried out in view of possible changes in semeiology of vertigo, increased the percentage of cured patients to 82.5% after the 2nd, 90.7% after 3rd and 94.1% after the 4th. Repeated positioning manoeuvres in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo led to a progressive increase in percentage of cured vertigo, at the same time, allowing detection of those cases converted to multicanal pathology, hence offering the possibility to proceed with appropriate liberating manoeuvres.</td>

	<td>Treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is based on Semont's Liberatory Manoeuvre and on so-called "Canalith Repositioning Manoeuvres", derived from the original Epley technique. Both manoeuvres are very effective and choice of which to use depends on the experience of the physician. Semont's manoeuvre requires a quick movement of the patient in mass in the frontal plane, from the involved, to the contralateral side, which sometimes causes symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. In this technique, a secondary liberatory nystagmus is often observed as sign of the success of the manoeuvre. Repositioning manoeuvres are less fastidious because of the slow movements, but we rarely observe an objective sign of success like the liberatory nystagmus. In the present randomised trial, 300 patients with posterior canalo/cupulolithias were divided into 3 treatment groups: 100 treated by Semont Technique; 100 by a Repositioning procedure (Parnes technique); 100 by a new manoeuvre called "Quick Liberatory Rotation". Results of treatment are also compared with the natural evolution of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo observed in 18 untreated patients. Quick Liberatory Rotation is similar in the sequence of the positions of the head in the horizontal plane, to repositioning procedures, but is more like the Semont manoeuvre in the speed of the movement (about 180 degrees in less than one second). Quick Liberatory Rotation is easy to perform, well tolerated and very effective (success rate: 98% in one-three cycles). In the present investigation, a secondary liberatory nystagmus was observed in 76.1%, with a sensitivity of 81.9% in detecting patients who had completely recovered and a specificity of 43.8% in detecting failures. Effectiveness, in short and medium period (1-15 months), is similar to Semont and Parnes techniques. Authors consider Quick Liberatory Rotation, at present, a possible first choice technique in the treatment of posterior canalolithiasis.</td>

	<td>The differential diagnosis of vertigo in children is extensive. Otitis media and middle ear effusion could be the most common causes of vertigo in children, but there are some problems in detecting the other causes for vertigo because they are one of most frequent diseases of childhood. The purpose of this study is to review the clinical characteristics and both the audiological and vestibular findings of vertigo in children with normal eardrums, who do not show otitis media or middle ear effusion, and to assist in making a differential diagnosis of vertigo. The fifty five children (< 16 years old) with vertigo, who visited the Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, South Korea between January 1995 and December 2001 were selected for this study. These excluded the patients with abnormal eardrums/tympanograms or those that did not perform questionnaires, audiological, or vestibular evaluations. They were retrospectively analyzed for clinical symptoms, vestibular functions, and differential diagnosis. The most common causes for vertigo in children were migraine in 17 (30.9%) and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC) in 14 (25.5%). Other less frequent causes included four cases of trauma, two cases each of Meniere's disease, delayed endolymphatic hydrops, benign positional vertigo, and one case only for cerebellopontine angle tumor, seizure, acute vestibular neuritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, leaving ten cases (18.2%) as unclassified. Abnormal findings were noted in 13 (23.6%) in pure tone audiogram, 3 (5.5%) in positioning test, 6 (10.9%) in bithermal caloric test, and 36 (65.5%) in rotation chair test. The vertigo in children with normal eardrums, who did not show otitis media or middle ear effusion, was most commonly caused by migraine and BPVC. These findings have shown to be very different from those with adult vertigo. The evaluation of vertigo in children requires a questionnaire for extensive and complete history taking, audiograms and vestibular function tests. And in selected cases, electroencephalography, hematological evaluation, imaging of the brain or temporal bone should be performed.</td>

	<td>To report on the most common causes of vertigo in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and emphasize appropriate diagnostic techniques and treatment interventions. True vertigo is estimated to occur in about 20% of MS patients. Lesions within the vestibular nuclei and in the root entry zone of cranial nerve VIII represent the most common locations where demyelinating activity can provoke vertigo in patients with MS. However, other causes of vertigo should be explored in MS patients in order to avoid unnecessary treatment with corticosteroids and vestibular suppressants. Recently, we reviewed our four-year experience with new onset vertigo in our university-based MS population and found that benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) to be the most common cause. All patients diagnosed with BPPV were treated successfully with particle repositioning maneuvers. The remaining patients were treated with conventional therapies appropriate for the specific diagnosis. Empiric treatments with corticosteroids and/or vestibular suppressants should not be employed until all MS patients undergo a careful bedside examination, which includes diagnostic positional and, if indicated, particle repositioning maneuvers. Here we emphasize the pathophysiology of BPPV and illustrate the proper techniques for the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers.</td>

	<td>One of the clinical characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is that the more quickly the head position changes, the more severe the vertigo. This suggests that the velocity of the head change is critical in determining the occurrence and severity of vertigo. The aim of this study was to examine factors determining the symptoms of BPPV using models of canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis. Canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis models were prepared using the bullfrog posterior semicircular canal (PSC). The ampullary nerve discharges were compared between quick and slow positional changes to examine factors determining the symptoms of BPPV. In the canalolithiasis model, the acceleration of the otoconia was greater for the quick positional change. This resulted in a greater discharge with a longer duration. With the slow positional change, the discharges were smaller and shorter. In the cupulolithiasis model, the discharges were sustained and their magnitude did not differ between the quick and slow positional changes. The canalolithiasis model influenced the magnitude of discharge of the PSC depending on the speed of the positional change. Canalolithiasis is the more likely mechanism of BPPV, which is characterized by various degrees of vertigo upon kinetic positional change.</td>

	<td>Sense organ deposits have been described in temporal bones from patients with vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's disease, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo that are not found in a comparable series of temporal bones without vestibulopathy. Because the recurrent vestibulopathies are caused by vestibular ganglionitis and the vestibulocochlear anastomosis was degenerated in these temporal bones, the deposits may represent the end buds of regenerating efferent axons injured in passage through the vestibular ganglion. Such neural buds have been described with transmission electron microscopy in animals after vestibular nerve transection and in a human temporal bone with endolymphatic hydrops. The buds may be visible by light microscopy, because their size is comparable to that of hair cell nuclei and they stain blue with hematoxylin because of their nucleic acid content. The variable location and size of these deposits (buds) in the labyrinthine sense organs is described to aid in the recognition of efferent system injury in human temporal bones.</td>

	<td>The pathophysiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is not completely understood. Although the concept of degenerated otoconia transforming the posterior canal (PC) crista into a gravity-sensitive sense organ has gained popular support, several temporal bone (TB) series have revealed similar deposits in normal TBs, suggesting they are a normal change in the aging labyrinth. Furthermore, some TBs from patients with BPPV do not contain particles in the posterior canal. Five TBs from patients with BPPV were studied quantitatively and qualitatively. A small PC cupular deposit was found in 1 TB, while none was seen in the other 4 TBs. The major pathological changes were 1) a 50% loss of ganglion cells in the superior vestibular division of all 5 TBs and 2) a 50% loss of neurons in the inferior division of 3 TBs, and a 30% loss in 2 TBs that contained abnormal saccular ganglion cells. These observations support a concept in the pathophysiology of BPPV that includes loss of the inhibitory effect of otolith organs on canal sense organs.</td>

	<td>This review discusses the physiology and pharmacological treatment of vertigo and related disorders. Classes of medications useful in the treatment of vertigo include anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, calcium channel antagonists and dopamine receptor antagonists. These medications often have multiple actions. They may modify the intensity of symptoms (e.g. vestibular suppressants) or they may affect the underlying disease process (e.g. calcium channel antagonists in the case of vestibular migraine). Most of these agents, particularly those that are sedating, also have a potential to modulate the rate of compensation for vestibular damage. This consideration has become more relevant in recent years, as vestibular rehabilitation physical therapy is now often recommended in an attempt to promote compensation. Accordingly, therapy of vertigo is optimised when the prescriber has detailed knowledge of the pharmacology of medications being administered as well as the precise actions being sought. There are four broad causes of vertigo, for which specific regimens of drug therapy can be tailored. Otological vertigo includes disorders of the inner ear such as Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and bilateral vestibular paresis. In both Ménière's disease and vestibular neuritis, vestibular suppressants such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines are used. In Ménière's disease, salt restriction and diuretics are used in an attempt to prevent flare-ups. In vestibular neuritis, only brief use of vestibular suppressants is now recommended. Drug treatments are not presently recommended for BPPV and bilateral vestibular paresis, but physical therapy treatment can be very useful in both. Central vertigo includes entities such as vertigo associated with migraine and certain strokes. Prophylactic agents (L-channel calcium channel antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers) are the mainstay of treatment for migraine-associated vertigo. In individuals with stroke or other structural lesions of the brainstem or cerebellum, an eclectic approach incorporating trials of vestibular suppressants and physical therapy is recommended. Psychogenic vertigo occurs in association with disorders such as panic disorder, anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines are the most useful agents here. Undetermined and ill-defined causes of vertigo make up a large remainder of diagnoses. An empirical approach to these patients incorporating trials of medications of general utility, such as benzodiazepines, as well as trials of medication withdrawal when appropriate, physical therapy and psychiatric consultation is suggested.</td>

	<td>Positional vertigo is a frequent clinical manifestation of vertigo of very different etiologies, being the benign paroxystic positional vertigo (BPPV) the most frequent one of them, representing in some series even the most found etiology of peripheral vertigo. Usually of severe entities, positional vertigo may appear in the context of severe entities and of difficult diagnosis. In these cases, the bearing of the symptoms in spite of the repositioning manoeuvers, the association with otological or neurological symptoms, and the atypical nystagmus evoked by Dix-Hallpike manoeuver, must take the otolaryngologist to suspect of a feasible non benign pathology. We report a case of positional paroxysmal vertigo caused by an intracranial tumour and we review the clinical signs that shoved help us to suspect of non benign pathologies that can mimic a positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>A 54-year-old woman complained of positional vertigo. During 3 months' observation, the patient showed mostly geotropic or apogeotropic nystagmus due to right canalolithiasis or cupulolithiasis, however, she sometimes showed nystagmus which suggested left horizontal canalolithiasis. We suspected that she suffered from bilateral horizontal canal type benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and performed Lempert's maneuver for both directions, however, they were ineffective. She underwent canal plugging for right horizontal canal. After surgery she showed no positional nystagmus of right horizontal canal origin. However, apogeotropic nystagmus of the left horizontal canal origin was still observed. This nystagmus changed to geotropic nystagmus and finally disappeared following Lempert's maneuver for the left side. Bilateral horizontal canal BPPV is difficult to be resolved, probably because physical treatment for one side would move debris to the cupula in the other canal. Canal plugging combined with Lempert's maneuver to the other side is one treatment option for intractable bilateral horizontal canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder resulting from a malfunction of the semicircular canal. Prior studies attempting to elucidate the mechanics of BPPV have focused on clinical and laboratory findings, and have discussed theoretical aspects only in qualitative terms. The goal of this study is to create a mathematical description of BPPV mechanics based on biophysical principles, in order to improve the physiopathological understanding of the most common varieties of the disorder, canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis. First, the abnormal stimulus being applied to the vestibular system during BPPV episodes is estimated by an analysis of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) response of clinical BPPV patients. The magnitude and time course of the head motion stimulus that would, in a normal test subject, produce a VOR response similar to that observed during BPPV nystagmus are inferred from eye motion data using an inverse transfer function approach. Next, physicomathematical models to describe the mechanics of the abnormal stimulations of the crista are created: the cupulolithiasis model is based on the principle that dense particulate matter becomes attached to the cupula of affected patients and effectively changes the specific gravity of the cupula; the canalithiasis model is based on the hydrodynamic effects from a cluster of particles falling within the canal endolymph. The stimuli predicted by these two models are compared to the stimuli estimated from physiological and clinical studies. The model predictions are found to be consistent with the empirical evidence for a reasonable set of model parameters. The cupulolithiasis model predicts a value of 0.69 micro g as the mass of particles contributing to the disorder. The canalithiasis model predicts a value of 0.087 micro g. These results support and expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the production of the cupulolithiasis and canalithiasis varieties of vertigo in humans. On the basis of these models, several predictions that can help the clinician improve the evaluation of BPPV patients are discussed.</td>

Conservative management of head trauma resulted in satisfactory outcome except for conductive hearing loss and faciel palsy. Facial palsy was managed conservatively [physiotherapy and oral steroids] with full recovery of function after 4 weeks. Conductive hearing loss was managed by combined approach tympanaplasty. Preoperutively incudostapedial joint dislocation and fracture anterior crus of stapes were noted. Type II tympanoplasty with horizontal incus repositioning was carried out.PTA after 6 weeks showed 15-20 dB air-bone gap compared to 50-55dB air-bone gap preoperatively. BPPV recovered spontaneously.

	<td>When a patient complains of dizziness, the term may cover several types of sensations. When the physician carefully takes the history, he or she will most often be able to differentiate between vertigo and other types of dizziness, including a feeling of lightness or fainting. Based on this differentiation, the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) designed a practice guideline for its members. The most important causes of vertigo are paroxysmal benign positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease and TIA or stroke in the vertebrobasilar system. Differentiation between vestibular neuritis and stroke may be difficult, in particular at the onset of the complaints and therefore consultation of a neurologist will often be necessary. Fortunately, special drugs for dizziness are not recommended, as their effectiveness has not been proven. Among the causes of non-vertigo dizziness complaints, hyperventilation, often in the context of anxiety disorder, is a major cause. In general, the NHG succeeded in compiling a practical guideline.</td>

Retrospective study in an outpatient clinic. Two hundred seventy-eight patients presenting with symptomatic, unilateral BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal, exclusively treated with the Semont maneuver. During the first consultation, each patient was treated with a Semont maneuver. When BPPV persisted, this maneuver was repeated during follow-up visits, performed at weekly intervals. Patients were considered cured when vertigo disappeared within 30 days (allowing up to 4 maneuvers). More than 90% of patients were cured after a maximum of 4 maneuvers, and 83.5% were cured after only 2 maneuvers. The efficacy of the maneuver decreased each time it was repeated (from 62.6% at the first maneuver to 18.2% at the fourth). The duration of symptoms before initial consultation and the etiology of BPPV had a significant effect on the maneuver's efficacy (P<.001 and P =.002, respectively), whereas age (P =.12), sex (P =.06), and affected side (P =.20) had no effect. The Semont maneuver demonstrated a 90.3% cure rate after a maximum of 4 sessions. Patients consulting late (>6 months after the beginning of symptoms) or having traumatic BPPV had lower recovery rates than patients without these factors (74.7% vs 96.5%).</td>

Forty individuals with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were investigated. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the history of recurrent sudden crisis of vertigo and positional-induced nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike test. All patients were treated by a single particle repositioning maneuver, and relapses were investigated at Days 7 and 30 posttreatment. Percentage of patients with negative Dix-Hallpike test after treatment, scores obtained on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short Form before and 30 days after treatment. DHT was found negative in 76% (28 of 37) individuals at 30 days. The eight scales of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey had a good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7) in patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The average standardized score for each 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scale was compared with the reference population normative data, showing differences with norms for all scales, except for Vitality. After particle repositioning maneuver, patients scored closer to norms, and Social Function and Mental Health scores were significantly higher than the scores obtained before the particle repositioning maneuver (p < 0.05). Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short Form total score significantly decreased from 18.05 +/- 9.91 (mean +/- standard deviation) at the first day to 9.54 +/- 9.94 at 30 days (p < 0.001). All 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scale scores were correlated significantly with Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short Form total scores at 30 days after treatment. Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has a significant impact on health-related quality of life, and patients experienced a decrease in quality of life as compared with norms. The particle repositioning maneuver improves health-related quality of life in posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

Vertigo is differentiated into peripheral and central vestibular abnormalities. Peripheral vestibular causes include Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuronitis, otitis media and labyrinthitis. The predominant lesions in our field causing central vestibular disorders are brainstem and posterior fossa tumors. Mastoiditis, meningitis, petrositis, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, extradural abscess, brain abscess, otitic hydrocephalus, cholesteatoma and cholesterol granuloma are complications of otitis media and middle ear disease. Sensorineural hearing loss is now readily treated with cochlear implantation. Facial nerve paralysis may result from infectious and other etiologies.</td>

	<td>Benign Peripheral Paroxysmal Vertigo is a disease of the posterior labyrinth caused by endolymphatic debris, provoking vertigo with some movements of the head. Diagnosis is usually made by finding the positional nystagmus with appropriate manoeuvres. Spontaneous resolution is frequent and in these cases diagnosis is only probable and suspected from anamnesis. Aim of the present investigation was to establish more evaluation parameters in the study of Benign Peripheral Paroxysmal Vertigo. A series of 97 selected patients presenting Benign Peripheral Paroxysmal Vertigo, have been submitted to sinusoidal kinetic test. Patients have been studied during the acute phase of the condition and after recovery. Vestibulo-oculomotor reflex has been sought by stimulating the horizontal and vertical canals. Kinetic stimulus consisted in sinusoidal rotation at 0.12 Hz and 0.05 Hz. Evaluation parameters comprised preponderance, gain and phase of provoked nystagmus, recorded by means of an Ulmer videonystagmograph. Using this same technique of stimulation, 20 normal volunteers were studied in order to establish normal values for reference. Values obtained in the patient population of patients have been compared, by Student t test, with values obtained in the same cured patients and with those in normal subjects. In the patients with Benign Peripheral Paroxysmal Vertigo of the lateral canal a nystagmus preponderance toward the healthy side was observed, as well as an increase in the phase lead, also in the canals not affected by the condition. In cured patients, disappearance of the preponderance and persistence of the phase abnormalities are observed. These results suggest a multicanal pathogenesis of Benign Peripheral Paroxysmal Vertigo.</td>

Cases were classified into 4 groups: 1) peripheral disorders (35.7%), 2) central disorders (7.9%), 3) disorders of other origins (8.3%), and 4) disorders of unknown origin (47.1%). Group 1) involved vestibular neuritis (10.1% of all cases), Meniere diseases (12.4%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (5.8%), and sudden deafness with vertigo (5.8%). Patients with vestibular neuritis--25 subjects including men (68%) and women (32%)--tended to be admitted mainly in July. Vestibular compensation in 15 patients with vestibular neuritis was studied using the platform stabilometry. The total length of a locus and the area of surroundings with open eyes decreased significantly (p < 0.05) as the condition of patients improved. In conclusion, many subjects reporting vertigo and dizziness had vestibular neuritis and few had BPPV. We found platform stabilometry to be useful in estimation of improvement in patients with vestibular neuritis.</td>

	<td>Whole membranous labyrinths of bullfrogs were used in order to replicate the human vestibule. The posterior semicircular canals (PSCs) were exposed, leaving the remaining membranous labyrinth encapsulated in the otic capsule. Vibration was applied to the surface of the bony capsule using a conventional surgical drill in order to dislodge the otoconia from the utricle. The position of the preparation was controlled so that the dislodged otoconia were attached to the cupular surface. This was regarded as a cupulolithiasis model. The action potentials changed instantaneously according to the gravitational force on the cupula. When the otoconia were dislodged and held within the PSC lumen, the position of the whole preparation was changed so that the otoconia moved back and forth within the canal lumen. This is a model of canalolithiasis. The action potentials changed in combination with the otoconial movement after a latent period. Both cupulolithiasis and canalolithasis are potentially valid mechanisms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, canalolithiasis is the most likely mechanism of BPPV, which is usually characterized by nystagmus of short duration and long latency. A vibratory stimulus was able to detach the otoconia from the utricle, suggesting that mechanical insult could be a possible etiology of BPPV.</td>

	<td>There is compelling evidence that free-floating endolymph particles in the posterior semicircular canal underlie most cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Recent pathological findings suggest that these particles are otoconia, probably displaced from the otolithic membrane in the utricle. They typically settle in the dependent posterior canal and render it sensitive to gravity. Well over 90% of patients can be successfully treated with a simple outpatient manoeuvre that moves the particles back into the utricle. We describe the various techniques for this manoeuvre, plus treatments for uncommon variants of BPPV such as that of the lateral canal. For the rare patient whose BPPV is not responsive to these manoeuvres and has severe symptoms, posterior canal occlusion surgery is a safe and highly effective procedure.</td>

	<td>Many patients with respiratory failure related to neuromuscular disease receive chronic invasive ventilation through a tracheostomy. Improving quality of life, of which speech is an important component, is a major goal in these patients. We compared the effects on breathing and speech production of assist-control ventilation (ACV) and bilevel positive-pressure ventilation (BPPV) in nine patients with neuromuscular disease. Ventilator-delivered flow was measured using a pneumotachograph, and respiratory rate, inspiratory time, and ventilator-delivered volume were measured on this flow signal. Gas exchange was assessed using oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement. Microphone speech recordings were subjected to quantitative analysis. At rest, ventilatory parameters were similar with both modes. Speech induced an increase in inspiratory time during BPPV, with a greater increase in the volume released by the ventilator during speech as compared with ACV (172 +/- 194 versus 26 +/- 31 ml). Consequently, speech duration was longer during inspiration with BPPV. Moreover, BPPV allowed speech production to extend into expiration, and three patients could speak continuously during several respiratory cycles while receiving BPPV. Blood gas exchange was not modified by speech with BPPV or ACV. This study shows that BPPV provides better speech duration than ACV with no detectable short-term deleterious effects.</td>

In this randomised, controlled, 6-month efficacy trial, 40 patients affected by BPPV were treated with Semont's maneuver. Outcomes were measured subjectively by patients about their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and quality of life, based on the "Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale". Results were compared to those obtained in 40 non-treated BPPV patients. During the first month of the study, 92.5% of patients of Semont's group resolved their symptoms. Cure rates with Semont's maneuver were significantly higher than those obtained with no-therapy (92.5% versus 37.5%). Within a six month follow-up, relapse rates were lower among patients treated with Semont's maneuver than among the no-treated ones (5% versus 60%). All patients with a resolution of symptoms and a negative Dix-Hallpike's test presented a great improvement in daily activities and quality of life. BPPV is easy to solve with a successful repositioning maneuver. Since BPPV is a very common cause of vertigo and can represent a medical emergency, we believe that it is of interest for every general practitioner to be able to promptly recognize this frequent balance disorder and to be able to treat a patient affected by BPPV with a safe repositioning maneuver.</td>

For each patient we determined their movement disabilities, and assessed the suitability of particle repositioning manoeuvres, Brandt-Daroff (B-D) manoeuvre and HT for them. All of these nine patients had neck or trunk movement disabilities due to orthopedic disease, and we judged that particle repositioning manoeuvres and B-D manoeuvre were impossible or too risky to be employed in them. Although HT was suitable for them and symptoms and signs of them improved within a short period of time. Particle repositioning manoeuvres were not suitable for BPPV patients with the movement disability because these manoeuvres required various movements. These patients were able to perform HT depending on their capabilities. We think that HT is caused by the fatigability of BPPV, and it accelerates the natural curing process.</td>

	<td>OBJECTIVE To investigate the hypotheses that physical neurotologic conditions may trigger anxiety disorders (otogenic pattern of illness), that psychiatric disorders may produce dizziness (psychogenic pattern), and that risk factors for these syndromes may be identified. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review of all patients (N = 132) treated at a tertiary care balance center from 1998 to 2002 for psychogenic dizziness with or without physical neurotologic illnesses. METHODS All patients underwent comprehensive neurotologic and psychiatric evaluations with attention to the longitudinal course of symptoms and risk factors for psychopathology. Patients were grouped according to the condition first causing dizziness. Risk factors were compared across groups. RESULTS Three equally prevalent patterns of illness were found: anxiety disorders as the sole cause of dizziness (33% of cases), neurotologic conditions exacerbating preexisting psychiatric disorders (34%), and neurotologic conditions triggering new anxiety or depressive disorders (33%). Panic disorder and agoraphobia were significantly more prevalent than less severe phobias in the first two groups, whereas the opposite pattern existed in the third group (P <.0001). More patients in the first two groups had risk factors for anxiety disorders (P <.05). Depression was not a primary cause of dizziness in any patient. Vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and migraine were the most common neurotologic conditions. CONCLUSIONS These data support the hypothesis that physical neurotologic conditions may trigger psychopathology as often as primary anxiety disorders cause dizziness. A third pattern appears to be equally common wherein physical neurotologic conditions exacerbate preexisting psychiatric illnesses. Individuals at risk for anxiety disorders may be more likely to have primary psychopathology.</td>

According to an analysis of 4,214 patients examined between 1989 and 2002 in an outpatient dizziness unit, benign peripheral paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and phobic postural vertigo (PPV) constitute the two most frequent syndromes. In this study, the relative age and sex distribution of both disorders was analysed. In the age group from 20 to 50 years, PPV was comparatively the most frequent form of dizziness, with a share of 22% to 26%. When left untreated, PPV becomes chronic in most cases and leads to considerable impairments, also at work. However, when diagnosed correctly, it can be treated successfully in more than 70% of cases. Thus, it takes on considerable medical and socioeconomic significance and should be part of the diagnostic repertoire of every doctor.</td>

Chronic headache attacks consistent with migraine were reported in 12 children and motion sickness was reported in 30. Family history in first degree relatives was positive for migraine in 29 children and for episodic vertigo in 22. Electronystagmography and videonystagmography showed two types of nystagmus: spontaneous vestibular nystagmus (41%) and benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPN) (59%). The first type of nystagmus was assessed as a sign of vestibulopathy and the patients with BPPN were diagnosed as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Audiometric examination in four cases revealed bilateral sensory neural hearing loss in low frequencies. Pure tone averages in 30 cases were within normal ranges; however low frequencies in 28 of them were approximately 10 dB lower than high frequencies. Unilateral caloric responses diminished in eight children. Peripheral vestibular problems in childhood present in a wide spectrum, which varies from a short episode of dizziness to a typical vestibular attack with fluctuating sensory neural hearing loss or episodes of BPPV. A considerable number of these vestibular problems might be related to the migraine syndrome.</td>

In many cases, the cause remains obscure, and it often affects women more than 50 years old. The goal of this work was to study a possible relationship between BPPV and osteopenia or osteoporosis. Thirty-two women, whose ages ranged from 50 to 85 years (median age, 69 years), who had BPPV and were free of any other otoneurologic history, were selected. The diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis was confirmed by a bone mineral density measurement made with dual x-ray absorptiometry of spine and hip (T-score). The BPPV was unilateral in 26 patients and bilateral in 6 patients. Our results showed osteopenia or osteoporosis in 24 of the 32 patients (75%) with BPPV. The T-scores were compared in 3 age groups to those of 83 healthy women. The patients with BPPV had a significantly lower (p < .026) T-score in all groups. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed to explain the apparent correlation between BPPV and osteopenia or osteoporosis.</td>

	<td>In this prospective study, 82 patients (40 males, 42 females, aged between 15 and 80 years) with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) were treated with different positioning manoeuvres using video-oculographic control. The maximum age for females and males was 31 and 40 years respectively. After an interview about the special history related to vertigo imbalance symptoms and using video-oculographic control, we diagnosed 79 patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal and 3 of the horizontal semicircular canal. The Dix-Hallpike and Cawthorne manoeuvres were used for the diagnosis of BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal and the McClure manoeuvre for the diagnosis of BPPV of the horizontal semicircular canal. 72% of the patients had an idiopathic BPPV and 12.2% were post-traumatic. 3.7% had BPPV after ear surgery and 2.4% were pregnant. 39 patients with posterior BPPV were treated with Semont's manoeuvre and 40 with Epley's. The 3 patients with horizontal BPPV were treated with Baloh's manoeuvre. More than half of the patients (52.5%) were free of symptoms after one session of Epley's manoeuvre and all of them after four sessions. 51.3% had no further symptoms after one session of Semont's manoeuvre and all of them after four sessions. These results, in agreement with the literature, show that the success rate of Semont's and Epley's manoeuvres is approximately the same. Video-oculographic control is helpful for the diagnosis and for the registration of the eye movements during the therapeutic manoeuvres.</td>

	<td>To compare the effectiveness and complications of our adaptation of the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) with the expectation treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A randomized, controlled trial in the setting of a neurotological clinic in Thailand. Fifty-eight patients with posterior benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups using a block of four. The treatment group was treated with the modified CRP technique until the nystagmus disappeared. A mastoid oscillator was not used, nor were any instructions given for patients after the maneuver. Both groups recorded the daily grading of symptoms and the amount of anti-vertiginous drugs (cinnarizine) taken. Objective and subjective assessments were made weekly until the nystagmus disappeared or until 4 weeks had passed since treatment began. The rates of effectiveness of CRP treatment and the control treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were 75.9% and 48.2%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the treatment outcomes of the CRP and control groups (P =.03). The CRP group used significantly fewer drugs than the control group (P =.001). Complications in the CRP group, such as lateral canalithiasis and fainting, were observed in 13.8% of the patients. The CRP was more effective than the expectation treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo insofar as it provided faster recovery and required less dependence on medication. Complications of CRP were limited to 13.8% of patients.</td>

	<td>To assess the incidence and characteristics of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and positional nystagmus in a series of patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Patients diagnosed with GCA between June 1999 and May 2001 at the single hospital for a defined population were examined prospectively. Patients included in this study fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for GCA. Otologic and oculographic studies were performed. Type, frequency, and outcome of positional oculographic findings was assessed. Patients were required to have been examined within 1 week after the onset of corticosteroid therapy. Data found in GCA patients were compared with those observed in an age, sex, and ethnically matched control population. Further studies in patients and controls were performed 3 and 6 months later. Forty-four patients and 44 matched controls were included in this study. Nine (20.5%) GCA patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria of BPPV compared with only 1 (2.3%) of the controls (P =.007). In seven of these nine GCA patients, BPPV was related to the posterior and two to the horizontal semicircular canals, respectively. Horizontal nystagmus was found in seven GCA patients who developed nystagmus in the head hanging position test compared with none in the controls (P =.006). The present study shows a higher frequency of BPPV in GCA than in matched controls. Because most clinical manifestations in GCA are caused by ischemic complications, our results suggest an ischemic etiology as responsible for BPPV in these elderly patients. According to these results, GCA may constitute a new association with BPPV.</td>

Results of Hallpike positional tests for benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (electro-oculography). Forty-one (41%) of 99 subjects were female and 58 (59%) were male. Age range was 15 to 73 years (mean, 47 years). Forty-nine (50%) of 99 subjects had an unequivocally positive Hallpike test for benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus in one or both ears. The occurrence of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus in the Hallpike-positive population was distributed equally across age decades. Of the 49 subjects with benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus, 22 (44%) were female and 27 (56%) were male. Benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus is the most common cause of vertigo in the general population, including subjects receiving ototoxic drugs. Complaints of vertigo in subjects receiving ototoxic drugs therefore may or may not indicate onset of ototoxicity. Occurrence of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus in subjects receiving ototoxic drugs was independent of gender or age. The high occurrence rate of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus in subjects receiving potentially ototoxic medications is consistent with the observation that benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus occurs in combination with many pathologic conditions. Benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus presenting in subjects receiving ototoxic drugs may complicate the clinical identification of ototoxicity and obfuscate clinical decision-making processes.</td>

The aim of the present study was to clarify whether BPPV manifests equally in both labyrinths or whether there is a preponderance for one side. We conducted a PubMed literature search of BPPV case series which specified the affected side and a retrospective chart review of 80 consecutive patients with BPPV of the posterior canal who had presented at our dizziness clinic. Eighteen studies with a total of 3426 patients were identified. In our own series the right side was affected in 54 of 80 patients (right/left ratio 2.08). Altogether, in 3506 patients the right labyrinth was involved 1.41 times more often than the left (95% CI 1.37 to 1.45). We think that the reason for the predominant involvement of the right ear in BPPV is the habit-of most patients-of sleeping on the right side.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common vestibular disorder, accounting for about 20% of referrals in specialized dizziness clinics. Nowadays, canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal has been widely accepted as the biological basis for typical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo as it is compatible with all clinical features of the disorder. Better understanding of its pathophysiological concepts has led to specific therapeutic strategies, which aim to clear the affected semicircular canal from mobile particles. After a single maneuver both Epley's and Semont's procedures lead to complete recovery in about 60% of patients and in nearly 100% when performed repeatedly. These positioning maneuvers have made benign paroxysmal positional vertigo the most successfully treatable cause of vertigo.</td>

	<td>The diagnostic pathway in a patient with vertigo starts with the accurate evaluation of medical history followed by a general physical and neurological examination. This step can often lead to the identification of the correct cause of the disease or, at least, to a distinction between peripheral and central vertigo. Neuroradiological investigations have to be considered as elective diagnostic procedures and include: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), MR angiography (MRA), angiography. For the diagnosis of peripheral vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, perilymphatic fistula, local trauma, toxic labyrinthitis, acute otitis media and chronic middle ear effusion,the role of imaging techniques is controversial. CT and MR are performed to rule out other pathologies and to confirm the diagnosis. Increased resolution and application of special MR sequences enhancing the intralabyrinthine fluids have enabled more detailed analysis of labyrinthine structures and pathology. Both T2 and T1 contrast sequences are necessary. A high resolution CT study is required when otitis media is suspected and in the follow-up of post-traumatic vertigo. The causes of central vertigo are numerous and include: vertebro-basilar circulation vascular events, multiple sclerosis (MS), migraine-associated vertigo, cerebellar and brainstem tumors, CNS infections. Among them cerebrovascular ischemia and multiple sclerosis are the most frequent. In these situations imaging studies become mandatory. CT can diagnose most cerebellar hemorrhages and some cerebellar and brainstem acute ischemia, enhanced MR has proved to be the most sensitive tool to detect posterior fossa lesion. Diffusion-weighted MR can reveal acute ischemic changes before routine MR. There has been evidence that MR angiography, providing angiogram-like images of the intracranial vessels may sometimes avoid invasive angiography. MRA resolution is not as good as traditional angiography and may also be compromised by movements and other artifacts. Selective angiography of the posterior circulation is often indicated for therapeutic decisions.</td>

	<td>This report presents a therapeutic procedure for refractory benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (antBPPV) of the anterior canal. Two patients with refractory antBPPV were treated by a prolonged forced position procedure (PFPP). The technique is based on the assumption that the pathophysiological mechanism of antBPPV is similar to that generating posterior canal canalolithiasis. The patients recovered from refractory antBPPV after one or more PFPPs. The rationale for this therapy is that when the patient lies in the proposed forced position, the affected anterior canal is uppermost in an almost gravitationally vertical position. If the patient remains in this position for several hours, the floating particles lying in the non-ampullary arm of the canal can gradually slip out of the canal towards the vestibule due to gravity. We recommend trying PFPP when the side of lithiasis cannot be determined, in cases that are resistant to particle repositioning canal manoeuvres, and before considering canal plugging for refractory antBPPV.</td>

The VRP has been established at the Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital in Laval, PQ, to provide specialized rehabilitation to clients suffering from vertigo, dizziness, and/or impaired balance owing to lesions or disorders of the vestibular system. Presence or absence of nystagmus or vertigo during the Dix-Hallpike test, Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), and Dynamic Gait Index (DGI). Thirty-five patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior canal were treated with canalith repositioning manoeuvres. All of the patients (100%) had absence of nystagmus or vertigo after one to four treatment sessions. Forty-six patients with vestibular deficits or dizziness-disequilibrium completed the VRP, which consisted mainly of individualized eye-head and balance home exercise programs. At the end of the VRP, there was a significant decrease in DHI score (31 vs 57; p < .01) and a significant increase in DGI score (18.4 vs 22.6; p < .01). A range of modest to major improvements was shown by comparing initial and discharge scores of patients who had completed vestibular rehabilitation. The VRP appears to be beneficial for patients with a variety of vestibular disorders. Further research is needed to continue optimizing vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

Although the Epley's modified manoeuvre, or particle respositioning manoeuvre (PRM), is an effective treatment for this disorder, its impact on health outcome in patients over 60 years old is unknown. To assess BPPV health-related quality of life in elderly individuals using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short Form (DHI-S). A prospective study including new cases of BPPV in patients older than 60 years was carried out. The diagnosis was based on the history of recurrent sudden crises of vertigo and a typical positional-induced nystagmus during the DHT. All patients were treated by a single PRM and relapses were investigated a the 30th post-treatment day. DHT was found negative in 82% (23/28) individuals at 30 days. The eight scales of the SF-36 have a good internal consistency reliability in patients with BPPV (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7). The average standardized score for each SF-36 scale was compared with the reference population normative data, showing differences with norms for role physical, body pain, social function, role emotional and mental health. After PRM, patients restored scores to norms, showing a significant increase in role physical (p < 0.05), body pain (p < 0.04), vitality (p < 0.02), social function (p < 0.003) and mental health scores (p < 0.005). DHI-S total score significantly decreased from 17.19 +/- 9.06 (mean +/- SD) at the first day to 9.70 +/- 10.13 at 30 days (p < 0.001). BPPV has a significant impact on health-related quality of life in elderly patients on their emotional and physical states compared to those unaffected. The PRM can restore health-related quality of life in elderly patients with BPPV.</td>

	<td>Although head trauma is considered a common cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), clinical presentation and outcome of traumatic BPPV (t-BPPV) have not been systematically evaluated. To compare the clinical presentation, patient's response to physical treatment, and outcome of patients with t-BPPV with those with the idiopathic form (i-BBPV). Tertiary referral neuro-otology outpatient clinic. We reviewed the clinical records of 247 consecutive patients with posterior canal BPPV during the years 1997 to 2000. All patients were diagnosed using the Dix-Hallpike test and treated using the particle repositioning maneuver. Patients with an onset of positional vertigo within 3 days of well-documented head trauma were included in the t-BPPV group. The outcome was compared with the outcome of 42 patients with i-BPPV who were similarly treated and followed up. Twenty-one (8.5%) of the 247 patients with BPPV fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for t-BPPV. The most common cause of head trauma was motor vehicle crash, documented in 57% of the cases; half of the patients additionally suffered from a whiplash injury. While the other causes were diverse, common falls were predominant. Only 2 of the patients involved in motor vehicle crashes experienced brief loss of consciousness. Sixty-seven percent of patients with t-BPPV required repeated physical treatments for complete resolution of signs and symptoms in comparison to 14% of patients with i-BPPV (P<.001). During a mean +/-SD follow-up of 21.7 +/- 9.7 months, 57% of t-BPPV patients and 19% of i-BPPV controls had recurrent attacks (P<.004). The nature and severity of the traumas causing t-BPPV are diverse, ranging from minor head injuries to more severe head and neck trauma with brief loss of consciousness. It appears that t-BPPV is more difficult to treat than i-BPPV, and also has a greater tendency to recur.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres including the Epley manoeuvre. To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), EMBASE (1974 to 2004) and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was January 2004. Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: Epley manoeuvre versus placebo Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a "positive" Dix-Hallpike test to a "negative" Dix-Hallpike test Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Fifteen trials were identified but twelve studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving three trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. The studies included in the review (Lynn 1995; Froehling 2000; Yimtae 2003) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre or control group by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. There is some evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, although this is based on the results of only three small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long term resolution of symptoms. There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Orientation with respect to gravity is essential for the survival of complex organisms. The gravity receptor is one of the phylogenetically oldest sensory systems, and special adaptations that enhance sensitivity to gravity are highly conserved. The fish inner ear contains three large extracellular biomineral particles, otoliths, which have evolved to transduce the force of gravity into neuronal signals. Mammalian ears contain thousands of small particles called otoconia that serve a similar function. Loss or displacement of these structures can be lethal for fish and is responsible for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in humans. The distinct morphologies of otoconial particles and otoliths suggest divergent developmental mechanisms. Mutations in a novel gene Otopetrin 1 (Otop1), encoding multi-transmembrane domain protein, result in nonsyndromic otoconial agenesis and a severe balance disorder in mice. Here we show that the zebrafish, Danio rerio, contains a highly conserved gene, otop1, that is essential for otolith formation. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of zebrafish Otop1 leads to otolith agenesis without affecting the sensory epithelium or other structures within the inner ear. Despite lack of otoliths in early development, otolith formation partially recovers in some fish after 2 days. However, the otoliths are malformed, misplaced, lack an organic matrix, and often consist of inorganic calcite crystals. These studies demonstrate that Otop1 has an essential and conserved role in the timing of formation and the size and shape of the developing otolith.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder. It can be defined as transient vertigo induced by a rapid head position change, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is considered the most convincing theory of its pathogenesis and the development of appropriate therapeutic maneuvers resulted in its effective treatment. However, involvement of the horizontal or the anterior canal has been found in a significant rate and the recognition and treatment of these variants completed the clinical picture of the disease. This paper describes the advances in understanding how this disease is generated and discusses the current therapeutic modalities.</td>

A retrospective review of the records of 168 patients with this disease during the past 3 years was performed. Epidemiological data and results from the audiological and neuro-otologic workup, including electronystagmography, were recorded. One hundred fifty-one patients had involvement of the posterior canal, 14 of the horizontal canal, and 3 of the anterior canal. Seventy-two patients (42.8%) had abnormal findings on the caloric tests. Thirty-seven of them (22%) had canal paresis and 23 (13.7%) had directional preponderance, whereas in 12 patients (7.1%) both unilateral weakness and directional preponderance were found. Finally, 21 patients (12.5%) had spontaneous nystagmus. It may be thus concluded that electronystagmographic abnormalities are quite common in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Their presence may be explained according to several mechanisms, which are further discussed herein.</td>

	<td>The objective was to determine whether the inclusion of vibration and additional treatment cycles has an effect on short- and long-term success rates in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with the canalith repositioning maneuver. Prospective randomized study of patients treated at a tertiary vestibular rehabilitation center. Variables identified for statistical analysis included patient age, gender, vibration used, and canalith repositioning cycles. Analysis using Student t test, chi2 test, Kaplan-Meier curves with log rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed. One hundred two patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo treated over a 1-year period (August 2001-August 2002) were randomly assigned to receive the canalith repositioning maneuver with or without vibration. Average duration of follow-up was 9.44 months. The single treatment success rate was 93.1%. To relieve symptoms, 29.4% of patients required more than one canalith repositioning cycle. The relapse rate was 30.5%. Thirty-nine patients were assigned to the canalith repositioning group with vibration, and 63 to the canalith repositioning group without vibration. There was no statistical difference in age, gender, initial success rates, or relapse rates between the canalith repositioning groups with and without vibration. On average, patients required 1.38 canalith repositioning cycles for successful treatment. Vibration did not affect the number of canalith repositioning cycles required to convert the Dix-Hallpike test result to normal. The need for additional canalith repositioning cycles had no statistical effect on initial treatment success or relapse rates. Vibration provided no additional benefit in initial treatment success or in reducing long-term relapse rates when included in the canalith repositioning maneuver. Many patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo require more than one canalith repositioning cycle at the time of initial treatment to relieve symptoms, but this does not indicate a higher likelihood for recurrence. No variable predicted a higher rate of recurrence.</td>

The questionnaire was mailed to 740 members and returned by 480 members (65%). Cervical manipulation (84.5%) and passive mobilization (99.8%) were used by a high percentage of respondents. Most were familiar with the protocol with 63% supporting its continued endorsement. Adverse effects were reported at a rate of one per 1000 years of practice (or 0.003/week). The most common effects were symptoms potentially related to VBI (94.4% responses), with no reported major complications. Only 37.1% of respondents always informed the patient about potential dangers of cervical manipulation and consent was sought on every occasion by 33% of respondents. The results suggest that the use and interpretation of the protocol are variable among members of MPA. The risk of adverse effects from manipulative (musculoskeletal) physiotherapy practice, including cervical manipulation, appears to be very low. Recommendations for revision of the protocol were made on the basis of results of the survey and treatment diary, in addition to a review of the literature related to testing for vertebro-basilar insufficiency, adverse incidents related to cervical mobilizing and manipulative technique, differentiating features of VBI related dizziness and vertigo related to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and current issues surrounding informed consent.

Eighty-four subjects with unilateral posterior canal BPPV were randomized into two groups. The oscillator group was treated by CRP with mastoid oscillation and the nonoscillator group was treated by CRP alone. Positive outcome was regarded as complete resolution of symptoms and a negative Dix-Hallpike's test after a 4 to 6 week follow-up period. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-eight (72%) patients from the oscillator group and 26 (65%) patients from the nonoscillator group had a positive outcome.

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness can be related to migraine in various ways: causally, statistically or, quite frequently, just by chance. Migrainous vertigo (MV) is a vestibular syndrome caused by migraine and presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days and migrainous symptoms during the attack. MV is the most common cause of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and is presently not included in the International Headache Society classification of migraine. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Ménière's disease (MD) are statistically related to migraine, but the possible pathogenetic links have not been established. Moreover, migraineurs suffer from motion sickness more often than controls. Persistent cerebellar symptoms may develop in the course of familial hemiplegic migraine. Dizziness may also be due to orthostatic hypotension, anxiety disorders or major depression which all have an increased prevalence in patients with migraine.</td>

	<td>A morphologically descriptive 3-canal mathematical model was developed to quantify the biomechanical origins of gravity-dependent semicircular canal responses under pathological conditions of canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis--conditions associated with the vestibular disorder benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The model describes the influence of displaced calcium carbonate debris (particles) located within the labyrinth on the time-dependent responses of the ampullary organs. The particles were modeled as spheres free to move in the canal lumen (canalithiasis) or adhered to a cupula (cupulolithiasis). The model predicts canal responses to the diagnostic Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and to a modified Epley canalith repositioning (CRP) treatment. Results for canalithiasis predict activation latencies and response magnitudes consistent with clinical observations during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The magnitude of the response evoked by the Dix-Hallpike test was primarily due to the total weight of the particles while the latency to peak response was due to the time required for the stone to move from the ampulla to the posterior apex of the canal. Results further illustrate the effectiveness of the Epley CRP in repositioning the particles and relieving the symptoms of the canalithiasis type of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been recognized as the most common vestibular disorder; it is a term coined in 1952 by Dix and Hallpike, and it is most commonly used to describe a disease with a characteristic clinical presentation believed to be caused by free-floating particles leaving the macula and entering one of the semicircular canals, usually the posterior one, more rarely the horizontal or superior ones. A lot of studies showed as the prevalence is higher in females than in males with a ratio of 2:1; furthermore, prevalence increases with the age: the mean age at onset is 54 years, with a range of 11 to 84 years. The most important clinical manifestations of BPPV are: vertigo, lightheadedness, dysequilibrium and sometimes nausea, vomiting, pallor and sweating. The diagnosis of BPPV is very simple through the Dix-Hallpike test or the diagnostic Semont's maneuver; the increasing information about the BPPV's pathogenesis has led most authors to consider the rehabilitative therapy, and in particular the so-called Semont's "liberatory" maneuver, as the first choice treatment of BPPV, in relation to its quickness and efficacy. In this treatment the debris are moved from the posterior semicircular canal to another location within the vestibular labyrinth. In our review we consider the possible pathogenesis of this disease and the best therapies, like repositioning maneuvers, in a patient affected by BPPV.</td>

	<td>The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of three therapeutic strategies (Semont maneuver, flunarizine, and no treatment) in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Randomized prospective trial. One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients older than 60 years of age who were affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal were enrolled. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the history of recurrent sudden crisis of vertigo and positional-induced typical nystagmus after Dix-Hallpike positioning maneuver. Patients were randomly allocated to receive Semont liberatory maneuver (intended as a statoconia-detachment maneuver), flunarizine, or no treatment. A post-treatment negative Dix-Hallpike test result was considered as a proof of vertigo resolution. Cure rates with Semont maneuver were significantly higher (94.2%) than those obtained with flunarizine (57.7%) and no treatment (36.4%) (P <.001). Within a 6-month follow-up, relapse rates were lower among patients treated with Semont maneuver (3.8%) than those obtained with flunarizine (5.8%) and no treatment (21.1%). All patients with resolution of symptoms and negative Dix-Hallpike test results showed a great improvement in daily activities and quality of life (P <.001). Semont liberatory maneuver is the most successful therapy for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and improves patients' quality of life. Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers are easy to perform and should be part of the medical knowledge of every general practitioner and geriatrician.</td>

	<td>To assess the dynamics of the vertical semicircular canal (VSCC)-ocular reflex in normal subjects and then to compare their gain in VSCC-ocular reflex with that of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Subjects were sinusoidally rotated around the earth-vertical axis with their head tilted 60 degrees backward and turned 45 degrees to the right or left side from the sagittal plane at frequencies of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 Hz with a maximum angular velocity of 50 degrees/s. Head rotation to the right side on the right anterior semicircular canal (SCC)-left posterior SCC plane or to the left side on the left anterior SCC-right posterior SCC plane stimulated the pair of VSCCs. Eye movements were recorded on a video imaging system with an infrared charge-coupled device camera, using our new technique for analyzing the rotation vector of eye movements in three dimensions. The mean gains in left posterior SCC-ocular reflex in normal subjects ranged from 0.44 at 0.1 Hz to 0.79 at 1.0 Hz, while the mean gains in right anterior SCC-ocular reflex ranged from 0.45 at 0.1 Hz to 0.73 at 1.0 Hz. The mean gains in right posterior SCC-ocular reflex in normal subjects ranged from 0.53 at 0.1 Hz to 0.89 at 1.0 Hz, while the mean gains in left anterior SCC-ocular reflex ranged from 0.53 at 0.1 Hz to 0.88 at 1.0 Hz. Thus, the gains in VSCC-ocular reflex did not differ among the four VSCCs in normal subjects. Similarly, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gains of the four VSCCs in patients with right- or left-sided BPPV were almost the same at all frequencies compared to those of normal subjects. In patients with BPPV, gains in VOR in the four VSCCs were not changed in comparison with those of normal subjects. It is suggested that the mass of free-floating otoconial debris associated with canalolithiasis was too small compared to that of the endolymph to change the canal dynamics.</td>

	<td>Two types of direction-changing positional nystagmus, the geotropic and apogeotropic variants, are observed in patients with the horizontal semicircular canal (HSCC) type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (H-BPPV). In this study, we assessed the dynamics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) of the HSCC in patients with H-BPPV. Patients were rotated about the earth-vertical axis at frequencies of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 Hz with a maximum angular velocity of 50 degrees/s. Eye movements were recorded on a video imaging system using an infrared charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and our new technique for analyzing the rotation vector of eye movements in three dimensions was used. In the patients with geotropic positional nystagmus, there were no differences in VOR gain between rotation to the affected and unaffected sides at frequencies of 0.1-1.0 Hz. Although no differences in VOR gain at frequencies of 0.3-1.0 Hz were noticed in patients with apogeotropic positional nystagmus, the VOR gain at 0.1 Hz was significantly smaller on rotation to the affected compared to the unaffected side. The results indicate that cupulolithiasis in the HSCC affected the dynamics of the HSCC-ocular reflex at 0.1 Hz, but not at higher frequencies, and that canalolithiasis in the HSCC does not change the VOR gain of the HSCC at any frequency. It is suggested that cupulolithiasis causes transient impairment of HSCC function by means of its mechanical restriction of movements of the cupula.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a mechanical disorder of the vestibular system in which calcite particles called otoconia interfere with the mechanical functioning of the fluid-filled semicircular canals normally used to sense rotation. Using hydrodynamic models, we examine the two mechanisms proposed by the medical community for BPPV: cupulolithiasis, in which otoconia attach directly to the cupula (a sensory membrane), and canalithiasis, in which otoconia settle through the canals and exert a fluid pressure across the cupula. We utilize known hydrodynamic calculations and make reasonable geometric and physical approximations to derive an expression for the transcupular pressure DeltaPc exerted by a settling solid particle in canalithiasis. By tracking settling otoconia in a two-dimensional model geometry, the cupular volume displacement and associated eye response (nystagmus) can be calculated quantitatively. Several important features emerge: (1) a pressure amplification occurs as otoconia enter a narrowing duct; (2) an average-sized otoconium requires approximately 5 s to settle through the wide ampulla, where DeltaPc is not amplified, which suggests a mechanism for the observed latency of BPPV; and (3) an average-sized otoconium beginning below the center of the cupula can cause a volumetric cupular displacement on the order of 30 pL, with nystagmus of order 2 degrees/s, which is approximately the threshold for sensation. Larger cupular volume displacement and nystagmus could result from larger and/or multiple otoconia.</td>

Records of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BPPV followed for 1 to 7 years were reviewed. The typical history of BPPV and the characteristic torsional positional nystagmus were identified in all patients. A modified Epley maneuver was performed for all patients with posterior semicircular canal BPPV, with a 98% success rate. The survey consisted of detailed patient questionnaires and vestibular tests. Migraine and motion sickness were three times more common in patients with BPPV than in the general population.

Meta-analysis. Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized, controlled trials of the CRP performed on clearly defined cases of BPPV. A total of nine studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified by two independent literature searches of Medline. Treatment and control groups were compared for symptom resolution and elimination of a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Patients treated with CRP were more likely to demonstrate symptom resolution (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-7.6) and negative Dix-Hallpike (OR 5.2; 95% CI 3.0-8.8) at the time of first follow-up. The effect of CRP for symptom improvement was strongest within the first month after treatment (OR 4.1; 95% CI 3.1-5.2) with some decline thereafter (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.7-3.9). Conversely, the ability of CRP to produce a negative Dix-Hallpike strengthened between the first month after treatment (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.8-4.0) and later follow-up times (OR 5.0; 95% CI 3.9-6.1). The CRP is more effective than control in resolving vertigo and positive Dix-Hallpike associated with BPPV. This finding was consistent among a variety of studies using different study designs. Untreated patients may demonstrate symptom improvement with time; however, many will continue to have a positive Dix-Hallpike when examined. Resolution of vertigo in untreated patients is therefore most likely because of avoidance of provocative positions.</td>

The control group (n = 85)--without any history of a hip fracture and living in a retirement home. Four clinical tests were given to each examinee in order to locate any impairment of the vestibular system. Three of the clinical examinations concentrated on testing the VOR while the fourth test was especially used to locate BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo). Sociodemographic status and medical history were taken. A significant difference was found between the two groups (those with a hip fracture and those without any hip fracture) with regard to the functioning of the VOR, age, endocrine disease and medications for treating diabetic. However, there was no significant difference found in the appearance of the BPPV. It is important to locate the elderly who are at risk of falling in nursing homes and the community at large by performing the four simple clinical tests. Correct diagnosis and early treatment of the vestibular impairment in elderly patient can prevent the next fall.</td>

	<td>A new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment both of geotropic and apogeotropic Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is proposed. To this end, a new strategy of approach to Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is described in order to rapidly highlight both the side and the affected canal. Thus, in the first treatment session, using the so-called "strategy of the minimum stimulus", a large percentage of cases are successfully treated, with the lowest number of vertigos for the patient. Following a review of the literature, 269 case studies, personally observed over a 4-year period, are described. The diagnostic strategy is performed by a single manoeuvre to determine whether the posterior semicircular canal or the lateral canal is affected. In the latter case, it is possible to highlight the affected sides both of the geotropic and apogeotropic forms. The therapeutic strategy comprises several liberatory manoeuvres, barbecue rotation techniques (Vannucchi-Asprella, Lempert), and Gufoni manoeuvre by continuously monitoring the ampullofugal movement of the otoliths. Almost 98% of cases are successfully treated at the first treatment diagnostic-therapeutic session. This approach to Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo allows a two-fold goal to be achieved, i.e., to effect both diagnosis and treatment at the first examination. Furthermore, thanks to the philosophy of the approach to Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, called the "Strategy of the minimum stimulus", patient compliance is very good since a very small number of vertigos are produced, and few neuro-vegetative disorders.</td>

	<td>We report 3 patients who complained of positional vertigo shortly after head trauma. Positional maneuvers performed in the plane of the posterior canal (PC; Dix-Hallpike maneuver) and the horizontal canal (HC; patients were rolled to either side in a supine position with the head raised 30 degrees) revealed a complex positional nystagmus that could only be interpreted as the result of combined PC and HC benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Two patients had a right PC BPPV and an ageotropic HC BPPV, and 1 patient had a bilateral PC BPPV and a left geotropic HC BPPV. All 3 patients were rapidly free of vertigo after the PC BPPV was cured by the Epley maneuver and the geotropic HC BPPV was cured by the Vannucchi method. The ageotropic HC BPPV resolved spontaneously. Neuroimaging (brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans) findings were normal in all 3 patients. From a physiopathological viewpoint, it is easy to conceive that head trauma could throw otoconial debris into different canals of each labyrinth and be responsible for these combined forms of BPPV. Consequently, in trauma patients with vertigo, it is mandatory to perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, as well as supine lateral head turns, in order to diagnose PC BPPV, HC BPPV, or the association of both. Early diagnosis and treatment of BPPV may help to reduce the postconcussion syndrome.</td>

We have studied the ability of patients with BPPV to correctly determine the subjective visual vertical, as this is a good test to evaluate utricular function. Only 1 of 10 patients with BPPV displayed a clearly abnormal response, and there was no correlation between the side of the lesion and the perceived tilt. This might imply that the limited damage induced by the dislodged otoconia does not disrupt utricular function or that the saccule is the source of the problem.</td>

Included in this prospective study were 103 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo seen in the Outpatient Department. Patients were classified into 4 groups according to treatment: Liberatory Manoeuvre according to methods described by Semont et al., with and without betahistine, Gradual Otolitis Dispersion Technique according to Brandt and Daroff, with and without betahistine. Evaluation was performed at baseline and at 3, 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after start of treatment. Response to treatment was evaluated using criteria of Epley. At day 14, liberatory manoeuvre-betahistine and Brandt and Daroff-betahistine groups did significantly better than liberatory manoeuvre and Brandt and Daroff groups (p < 0.05). Improvement reached at day 30 was: 100% in liberatory manoeuvre-betahistine group; 96.30% (p > 0.05) in Brandt and Daroff-betahistine group; these results were significantly better (p < 0.05) than those of liberatory manoeuvre (54.17%) and Brandt and Daroff (25%) groups. As far as concerns differences between disease onset and start of therapy (less and more than 2 weeks), and age (< or =60 years and > or =60 years), response to treatment was similar. In conclusion, both liberatory manoeuvre and Brandt and Daroff, when associated with betahistine, were significantly more effective than manoeuvres alone (p < 0.05). Improvement in liberatory manoeuvre-betahistine group, in the initial phase, was greater that in Brandt and Daroff-betahistine group, albeit, differences were not significant (p > 0.05). Age-related effects of manoeuvres were compared in 71 patients < 60 years and 32 patients > or =60 years, showing a similar improvement rate at the end of the investigation in both groups. In our opinion, liberatory manoeuvre and Brandt and Daroff associated with betahistamine produces faster recovery compared to liberatory manoeuvre and Brandt and Daroff alone. Nevertheless, 3 months after onset of treatment, all patients showed complete recovery due to spontaneous evolution of paroxysmal positional vertigo, in other words, treatment does not appear to influence the final improvement rate and its role should be accepted as a significant reduction in persistence of symptoms.</td>

Patients with HC-BPPV (n = 89) were diagnosed when the supine to the head-lateral test resulted in geotropic or ageotropic bilateral horizontal nystagmus. Three subtypes of HC-BPPV were defined by their characteristic patterns of nystagmus as well as by their speculative mechanism. Canalolithiasis (Can) denotes geotropic nystagmus induced by free-moving otoliths in the HC. Two forms of cupulolithiasis, characterized by otoliths attached either on the utricle-sided (Cup-U) or the canal-sided (Cup-C) cupula, were identified by whether ageotropic nystagmus resolved or changed to geotropic nystagmus on follow-up tests. Forced prolonged position (FPP), lying on the healthy side for 12 hours to easily move free otoliths to the utricle, has proven successful in treating Can. Although Cup-U and contralateral Cup-C were associated with the same positional nystagmus pattern, FPP with lying on the side of the weaker nystagmus was found to be effective treatment, as well as consistent with the speculated underlying mechanism. All HC-BPPV patients including 49 with Can, 11 with Cup-C and 29 with Cup-U had complete resolution of symptoms and positional nystagmus after less than four treatment sessions. FPP with lying on the side of the weaker nystagmus, combined with careful observation of nystagmus evolvement, was found to be effective treatment for all subtypes of HC-BPPV in this series.</td>

Case review. Outpatient clinic. The diagnosis of apogeotropic horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was based on the history of recurrent sudden crisis of vertigo associated with bursts of horizontal apogeotropic paroxysmal nystagmus provoked by turning the head from the supine to either lateral position. The patients were three men and five women ranging in age from 31 to 73 years (average, 49.2 yr). All patients were treated with a repositioning maneuver based on the hypothesis that the syndrome is caused by the presence of free-floating dense particles inside the endolymph of the anterior arm of the horizontal canal. The maneuver favors their shifting into the posterior arm of the canal. Patients were reexamined immediately after the treatment and underwent Gufoni's liberatory maneuver for the geotropic variant of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The treatment outcome was considered as responsive when, after one repositioning maneuver, nystagmus shifted from apogeotropic to geotropic. The repositioning maneuver resulted in a transformation from the apogeotropic variant into a geotropic variant of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in all patients. This maneuver represents a simple and effective approach to the treatment of the apogeotropic variant of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It favors the shifting of the canaliths from the anterior into the posterior arm of the horizontal canal from where they can migrate into the utricle with Gufoni's maneuver.</td>

Multilevel analyses showed that vertigo decreased significantly after LM, CRP, and Brandt-Daroff exercise; those three groups did not differ significantly. The habituation group did not differ from sham, Brandt-Daroff, LM, or CRP groups. Changes in scores were maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period. LM, CRP, and exercises are all effective interventions; patient education plus the sham maneuver, however, had some beneficial effect. These results support two possible mechanisms of BPPV: displaced otoconia and a neural mechanism affecting interpretation of semicircular canal signals.</td>

	<td>Paroxysmal positional vertigo (PPV) is a high prevalence, vestibular end organ disorder due to the detachment of the utricular otoconia floating in the posterior or lateral semicircular canal. Even though in the majority of cases the etiology of PPV is unknown, it may follow viral infection, vascular disorders and head trauma after different surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between PPV and the surgical trauma induced by the vibratory and percussive forces on the upper maxilla during the osteotome sinus floor elevation procedure. We performed a complete otoneurological examination on 146 patients affected by atrophic ridges before and after upper maxilla surgery. Four patients showed a PPV of the posterior semicircular canal controlateral to the implanted side 1 or 2 days after the surgical procedure, which promptly was solved with the Epley re-positioning maneuver. We hypothesize that the surgical trauma, and specifically the pressure exerted by the osteotomes, determines the detachment of the otoliths from the utricular macula while the patient head position, hyper-extended and tilted opposite to the side where the surgeon is working, favors the entry of these free-floating particles in the posterior semicircular canal of the implanted side. Although this disease is rather frequent in the normal population and it is a benign, self-limiting peripheral disorder, it should be considered by the oral surgeon as a possible complication of pre-prosthetic upper maxilla surgery, and the patient should be informed before undergoing surgery.</td>

Analysis of Variance was used to verify differences between the variables. An average of 2.13 procedures (from 1 to 8) was needed to eliminate the positioning nystagmus. Canalithiasis required an average of 1.53 procedures, while cupulolithiasis needed 2.92 procedures (p=0.0002). An average of two procedures was needed to eliminate the positioning nystagmus in cases with posterior canal involvement, 2.39 procedures in cases with anterior canal involvement and 2.07 procedures in cases with lateral canal involvement (p=0.5213).

To identify patients with BPPV among a variety of diagnoses represented by the ICD-10 diagnosis R42 in people 65 aged years and older who visited primary health care because of vertigo and dizziness. Searches were performed in the computerized medical records of 6 different health care centers over the period of 1 year for the ICD-10 diagnosis R42 and the age group 65 years and older. Letters were sent to the patients identified with an invitation for assessment and physical examination by a physiotherapist. Thirty-eight patients responded to the letter and were included in the study. All patients were assessed by physical examination including the Hallpike maneuver. The study group included 13 men and 25 women, 65-94 (median 83) years of age. After physical examination, 15 patients were found to have BPPV (confidence interval 24-55%). In this study, 2 of 5 of the patients with ICD-10 diagnosis R42 (dizziness and giddiness) had BPPV. BPPV is probably an underestimated cause of dizziness/vertigo among elderly patients in primary health care.</td>

At least 85% of cases had classical symptoms of BPPV and could have been easily identified by Primary Care Physicians at first referral, had they been trained to recognise and diagnose the condition. It was concluded that patients could be treated more efficiently and at less cost if the condition was identified at first referral in primary care, and treated in either primary care or dedicated BPPV clinics receiving referrals from primary care. A dedicated clinic for BPPV is recommended, which will substantially reduce waiting time for treatment and save primary care and hospitals time and money by avoiding unnecessary appointments and medication.</td>

Subjects were 13 patients with HC-BPPV visiting our vertigo outpatient clinic at Nara medical university hospital and a related hospital in the 2.5 years from January 2000 to June 2002. Subjects were classified into 7 with canalolithiasis and 6 patients of cupulolithiasis after a neurotological examination. CP was positive in 54% of all patients, 71% of those with canalolithiasis, and 33% of those with cupulolithiasis. To determine the affected side in HC-BPPV, we used the affected side by using the law of Ewald in canalolithaisis patients and the detection of a neutral diminishing nystagmus in cupulolithiasis patients. CP positive in caloric testing indicated insignificant dysfunction of the horizontal semicircular canal in canalolithiasis patients compared to that in cupulolithasis patients. The mechanism behind caloric nystagmus was thought to be a convection of endolymphatic fluid interrupted consequently by an otolith in the semicircular canal in canalolithiasis patients. In contrast, CP was positive in cupulolithiasis patients regarded as having no convection of endolymphatic fluid. The mechanism causing a difference in caloric test results between canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis patients thus requires a larger patient population and further examination to be conclusive.</td>

	<td>Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a very common cause of vertigo that can affect any of the semicircular canals. Posterior canal BPPV, by far the most frequent form of BPPV, can be effectively treated by a number of different physical methods. During the last few years the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV became so popular that in our tertiary referral Dizziness Clinic we encounter many cases of over-diagnosis, misdiagnosis and maltreatment. This review describes the various types of BPPV and the appropriate diagnostic work-up and treatment, emphasizing the adequate management of uncommon presentations. All physicians who receive appropriate training in BPPV should be able to accurately diagnose posterior canal BPPV by performing the Dix-Hallpike positional test and treat it immediately by one of the physical maneuvers with a success rate of 70%-90%. Futhermore, appropriately trained physiotherapists should be able to treat these cases. Repeated physical maneuvers during a single treatment session seem to be clinically superior to a single maneuver. The published post-treatment measures are inconvenient and should be abandoned. Patients who fail to respond to a single treatment session or with frequent recurrences of BPPV can be instructed to perform a "self-treatment" maneuver. The diagnosis of the different subtypes of horizontal canal BPPV (geotropic and apogeotropic nystagmus) requires special skill since cerebellar and brainstem disorders might also cause horizontal positional nystagmus. Two methods of treatment are commonly used: a rolling maneuver of 270 degrees or 360 degrees ("barbecue maneuver") and the "forced prolonged position" with a success rate of about 70% after a few maneuvers. About 20% of cases of horizontal BPPV fail to respond to these treatments. The anterior canal variant of BPPV characterized by torsional downbeat nystagmus is very rare. In such cases a detailed neurological examination is mandatory in order to rule out other causes of downbeat nystagmus. The authors recommend that patients with suspected horizontal or anterior canal BPPV should be immediately examined by a neurologist and if no other neurological abnormality is found a referral to a specialized dizziness clinic should follow.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most commonly diagnosed vertigo syndrome. It is caused by movement of detached otoconia within the inner ear (canalithiasis) or otoconia adherent to the cupula (cupulolithiasis). A mathematical model incorporating fluid dynamics of BPPV, which results in the following insights, has been developed recently: (1) The characteristic latency of BPPV is explained by movement of detached otoconia through the ampulla, as pressure caused by moving otoconia is negligible until otoconia enter the narrow duct of the semicircular canal. Typical otoconia move at a rate of 0.2 mm/s, or about 1% of the circumference of the canal each second. (2) Particle-wall interactions can account for the considerable variability in duration and latency of BPPV. (3) Dispersion of a clump of otoconia creates more rather than less nystagmus. Thus, dispersion is not a viable explanation of fatigability. (4) Cupulolithiasis is predicted to cause a far weaker nystagmus than canalithiasis. (5) Inertial effects of treatment maneuvers cause negligible movement of otoconia.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is an illusion of rotation due to a disorder of the vestibular system, almost always peripheral. In the history it must be distinguished from pre-syncope, seizures and panic attacks. A single attack of acute, isolated spontaneous vertigo lasting a day or more is due either to vestibular neuritis or cerebellar infarction; distinguishing between the two requires mastery of the head impulse test. Recurrent vertigo is mostly due to benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease or migraine. With a good history, a positional test, an audiogram and a caloric test, it is usually possible to distinguish between these. BPPV is the single most common cause of recurrent vertigo and can usually be cured immediately with a particle repositioning manoeuvre. Posterior circulation ischaemia very rarely causes isolated vertigo attacks and when it does the attacks are brief and frequent and the history is short.</td>

Every 2 months patients were mailed a questionnaire. If BPPV had recurred, patients contacted the principal investigator within 24 hours. Within 1 to 2 weeks, patients were evaluated in the clinic with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver or, if unable to travel to the clinic, interviewed by telephone. Symptoms recurred in 50 (43%) of the 116 subjects, 34 (47%) of 73 in the no-treatment group and 16 (37%) of 43 in the treatment group.

Although BPPV attacks are usually accompanied by autonomic symptoms, there are no studies assessing autonomic responses during triggering maneuvers for BPPV, neither in healthy subjects nor in patients. We evaluated nine healthy subjects and four BPPV patients (3 unilateral and 1 bilateral). Using a two-axis rotator, from an upright position they were rotated 135 degrees backwards to head-down tilt, either in the plane of the right or the left posterior canal. In healthy subjects, head-down tilt always induced a significant decrease of the pulse rate, which was similar after rotation to the right and to the left posterior canals. This response was observed in patients with unilateral BPPV only when they were rotated toward the nonaffected side, and it was not evident when they were rotated toward the affected side (p < 0.025). In the patient with bilateral BPPV, no change of the pulse rate was observed after rotation toward the right or to the left posterior canal. Although, in all the patients, the respiratory rate increased during the tilt, a similar increase was observed in two healthy subjects. After rotation in the plane of the affected semicircular canal, BPPV can interfere with the cardiac response to head-down tilt of the whole body.</td>

We conducted a prospective study of 30 ASC BPPV patients to analyze the efficacy of a modified CRP. When the patient was diagnosed as having ASC BPPV by a specific provocative positioning test, a CRP was performed. The response to the treatment was categorized as grade I-IV. Of the 30 study patients, 6 were male and 24 were female with the highest incidence when the patients were in their 50s. The vertigo and nystagmus in 29 patients fully resolved (grade I). Using this maneuver, 96.7% of patients became symptom free. Overall, the maneuver needed to be performed 1.97 times to control the symptoms. Based on these findings, CRP could be one of the most effective treatment methods for ASC BPPV.</td>

	<td>In this study, the deposits of basophilic material on the cupula of the semicircular canals in temporal bones from patients who had aminoglycoside administration within six months prior to death were compared with normal temporal bones. Subjects were divided into two groups. Group I included 24 normal control temporal bones age-matched to group II patients. Group II consisted of 23 temporal bones that had received aminoglycosides within six months prior to death. All temporal bones were examined under light microscopy. One (4.2 per cent) of 24 temporal bones in group I (normal) showed basophilic deposits. In group II, deposits were observed in 8 (34.8 per cent) of 23 temporal bones. The prevalence of basophilic deposits in group II was significantly higher than group I. This study demonstrates that within six months after aminoglycoside administration there is an increased prevalence of basophilic deposits on the surface of the cupula. Such changes may be related to the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) seen in some patients who have had aminoglycoside administration.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common symptom in older people that affects quality of life and increases the risk of falls. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of dizziness that increases in prevalence with age, and is potentially curable. To compare patients with BPPV referred initially to a Falls and Syncope Unit (FSS group) with those initially referred to a Regional ENT/Balance Service (ENT group). Retrospective case-note review. Medical notes, investigations and outcomes were reviewed for all patients. Of 59 patients with BPPV confirmed by Dix-Hallpike test, 31 (53%) were initially referred to the FSS (2.6 patients per month, 71% females) and 28 (47%) were initially referred to ENT (4.7 patients per month, 86% females). Compared to those referred initially to ENT, FSS patients were significantly older (mean +/- SD 69 +/- 13 vs. 55.4 +/- 13 years, p = 0.0003) and had dizzy symptoms for longer before diagnosis (median (range) 12 (4-120) vs. 6 (1-36) months, p = 0.0273). FSS patients were more likely to have more than one type of dizziness (16% vs. 0%, p = 0.001), more likely to have cerebrovascular or cardiovascular co-morbidity (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.0152) and were taking significantly more medications (3.2 vs. 1.7; p = 0.0271). Cure rates on intervention were similar (83% FSS, 86% ENT). BPPV is a potentially curable cause for dizziness in older people. Older people are frequently referred directly to Falls units, who will be seeing increasing numbers of patients with dizziness. A high index of suspicion allows early identification and treatment of this condition.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common and treatable vestibular disorder characterized by attacks of positional vertigo. Although elderly patients often complain about unsteadiness, the symptom of positional vertigo is seldom reported. Several studies on BPPV in the elderly reveal a low success rate in the treatment of this entity. To assess the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of BPPV in elderly patients and to compare them with those of the general population treated at our dizziness clinic. We reviewed the medical records of 23 patients above age 75 who were treated at our dizziness clinic for BPPV during the years 1998-2004. Their clinical data, BPPV characteristics and treatment outcome were compared with the data of 30 consecutive BPPV patients who represented the general population. No differences in gender distribution, duration of BPPV, treatment responsiveness or recurrence rate were found between elderly patients as compared to the general population. The duration of the last attack of positional vertigo was found to be longer in the elderly, probably due to the delay in recognition of symptoms and accessibility of a dizziness clinic. Our study shows that BPPV characteristics and treatment effectiveness, as measured by negative Dix-Hallpike maneuver, are not age-dependent and there is no need for a special approach or cautiousness in prognosis prediction. It is important to search actively for this condition since treatment leads to amelioration of unsteadiness and improved well-being in these patients.</td>

	<td>This review focuses on three neuro-otological syndromes, which are all marked by rapid scientific progress on the one hand but under-recognition or undertreatment on the other: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and its variants, superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, and migrainous vertigo. The efficacy of Epley's maneuver for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been convincingly demonstrated by a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials. Head vibration during Epley's procedure and keeping upright for 48 h after effective treatment do not improve the outcome. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome presents not only with sound and pressure-induced vertigo but also with conductive hearing loss at low frequencies. Migrainous vertigo may present not only with spontaneous attacks but also with positional vertigo or with chronic dizziness and imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to relieve chronic dizziness and visual vertigo. Recent studies have eliminated several white spots on the neuro-otological map. However, many areas are still unexplored, particularly with regard to treatment of specific vestibular syndromes where randomized controlled trials are just at their beginning.</td>

Medical records from two hundred and thirty cases with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo treated between January 2002 to June 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups,treatment group (122 cases) and control group (108 cases). Treatment group received a single treatment of canalith repositioning procedure based on the hypothesis that the vertigo and nystagmus of BPPV were due to debris floating in the long arm of the semicircular canal. Treatment outcome was analyzed after two weeks classified as cure, improvement or no change. After a single treatment of canalith repositioning procedure, the vertigo and nystagmus in 88 cases of treatment group immediately or gradually disappeared in 1-2 weeks, 18 cases improved, 16 cases got no effect. Complete remission of vertigo and nystagmus was found in 72.1%, the total improvement rate was 86.9%. The vertigo and nystagmus in 51 cases of control group immediately disappeared in 1-2 weeks, 23 cases improved, 34 cases got no effect. Complete remission of vertigo and nystagmus was found in 47.2%, the total improvement rate was 68.5%, and the difference between groups was very significant (P < 0.001, P < 0.01). The canalith repositioning procedure was effective for most patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and can be recommended as the first-line treatment modality.</td>

This includes anterior and horizontal canal variants and multiple positional nystagmus, suggesting combined lesions affecting several canals. To analyse the video-oculographic findings of positional tests in patients with BPPV. Seventy individuals with symptoms of BPPV and positional nystagmus were included in this study. The diagnosis was based on a history of brief episodes of vertigo and the presence of positional nystagmus as confirmed by video-oculographic examination during the Dix-Hallpike test, the McClure test or the head-hanging manoeuvre. Patients were treated by means of different particle repositioning manoeuvres according to the affected canal (Epley's manoeuvre for the posterior or anterior canals and Lempert's manoeuvre for the lateral canal) and the effectiveness was evaluated at 7 and 30 days. Twenty-nine individuals (41.43%) presented an affected unilateral posterior canal. Fifteen patients (21.43%) presented a pure horizontal direction-changing positional nystagmus consistent with a diagnosis of horizontal canal BPPV. Twelve individuals (17.14%) presented a unilateral down-beating nystagmus, suggesting possible anterior canal BPPV. In addition, 14 patients (20%) showed multiple positional nystagmus during the examination corresponding to simultaneous multi-canal BPPV, 5 had bilateral posterior canal BPPV and 2 presented a positional down-beating nystagmus in both left and right Dix-Hallpike manoeuvres and the head-hanging manoeuvre, which is highly suggestive of anterior canal BPPV. However, seven individuals showed positional horizontal and vertical side-changing nystagmus that could not be explained by single-canal BPPV. These patients with multiple positional nystagmus showed changing patterns of positional nystagmus at follow-up.</td>

Fifty individuals with PC-BPPV were included, and 45 (90%) completed the study. The diagnosis was based on the history of short episodes of vertigo and a positional nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT). All patients were treated by a single PRM, and relapses were evaluated by DHT at 30, 180 and 360 days post-treatment; a new PRM was performed if the DHT was positive. The main outcome measures were: percentage of patients with a negative DHT after treatment, scores obtained on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short Form (DHI-S) before and 30, 180 and 360 days post-treatment. The DHT was found negative in 80% (40/50) of individuals at 30 days. Ten, seven and five patients presented a positive DHT at 30, 180 and 360 days, respectively. Persistent BPPV was observed in 5% (2/50) of patients at 360 days, despite repeated PRM. Relapses (DH+ after successful PRM) were observed in 7.5% (3/50) at 180 days and 360 days. Both questionnaires showed a reliability Cronbach's alpha >0.7. The average standardized score for each SF-36 scale was compared with the reference population normative data, showing differences with norms for all scales except for vitality. After PRM, patients improved their scores with both instruments, indicating a restoration of HRQoL at 30 days. Physical dimension scores of the SF-36 improved from day 30 to 360. DHI-S scores were statistically better after PRM (P < 0.001). Our results show that the effectiveness of PRM is 88% after 1 year of follow-up. Patients with BPPV experienced a decrease in HRQoL, which was restored after PRM. Although relapses were observed in 7.5% of individuals, they did not affect HRQoL.</td>

	<td>The treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) consists of a repositioning maneuver in order to remove otoliths from the posterior semicircular canal and subsequent postural restrictions to prevent debris from reentering the canal. However, the extent to which postural restrictions affect the final outcomes of BPPV is still uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of postural restrictions in the treatment of BPPV, which is caused by otoliths in the posterior semicircular canal, and to evaluate its usefulness as a therapy. Seventy cases diagnosed as BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal were studied. All patients were treated utilizing the modified Epley maneuver. They were divided into two groups. The first group (group A, 35 patients) was instructed to sleep in a semi-sitting position and to avoid moving their heads forward or backward, whereas no instructions were given to the second group (group B, 35 patients). The information gathered from the patients was analyzed by age of onset, gender, duration of the disease and cure rates or recurrence rates. In group A, the average age was 54.5 years and the mean duration of symptoms was 116.5 days, whereas in group B, these measurements were 54.8 years and 86.7 days. The cure rates were 91.4 and 94.3%, respectively. Symptoms recurred in 12.5% of group A patients, while in group B, there was a 9.1% recurrence rate. Our study did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Postural restriction therapy, practiced after the modified Epley repositioning maneuver, did not have a significant effect on the final outcomes of BPPV. Based on our results, we do not recommend this therapy since there was no significant benefit for the patients who utilized postural restrictions.</td>

Twenty out of 150 (13.3%) patients complained about positional vertigo. The diagnosis of BPPV was confirmed in 10 patients. Signs and symptoms were completely relieved in six patients after a single PRM, while the other four patients needed repeated treatment for complete resolution of BPPV. About half of the patients with severe TBI who complain about positional vertigo suffer from BPPV.

We investigated the efficacy of analyzing and treating positional vertigo with a system that provides unlimited, automated maneuverability of the patient while maintaining constant electronic monitoring of nystagmus. A power-driven, multi-axial positioning chair combined with ongoing infrared video-oculography was used to manage 986 subjects in a tertiary clinical setting with complaints of positional vertigo. A nystagmus-based strategy and condition-specific protocols were used. Significantly enhanced treatment outcomes were achieved, especially regarding intransigent and variant forms. Pertinent correlations were noted. This multi-axial positioning chair combination provided enhanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities for managing positional vertigo, apparently due to improved analytical capability, precision repeatability, and unlimited 360-degree maneuverability. This advancement should be considered for tertiary management of complicated labyrinthine lithiasis.</td>

	<td>To study the relationship between age and posturography in patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo. Prospective study performed in 65 patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) in any variant. Sensory Organization Test outcomes were recorded and compared with their equivalents in a control group by means of scatter-plot diagrams and regression line. For statistical study, Mann-Whitney's U-test was used. Slope for regression lines in composite was -0.0934 in group NORMAL; in group BPPV it was -0.4284. This difference is due to conditions 5 and 6. Results were statistically significative. BPPV patients have a worse postural control than control group. The difference is bigger the older the patient is. It is due to a failure in conditions 5 and 6, so it should be from a vestibular origin.</td>

	<td>To ascertain the value of different positioning tests in diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Seventy-two patients who had determined the diagnosis of the posterior semicircular canal BPPV (PC-BPPV) in our department from Feb. 2000 to Apr. 2004 was tested with different positioning maneuvers. All cases were randomly divided into 2 groups with cross-over design. Group A with 36 subjects was tested with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver followed up by side-lying maneuver; Group B was tested in reverse order. Then, the Roll test was performed. The results had association (P > 0.01) between the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and side-lying maneuver, and the positive rate had no significant difference (P < 0.01). The features of vertigo and nystagmus provoked by the tests were the same. One patient was found combining with BPPV of horizontal semicircular canal (HC-BPPV) by the Roll test. As the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the side-lying test has the same diagnostic value in determine the PC-BPPV. Because it is safer and easier to perform in the condition of range-of-motion limitations such as spondylosis, it can alter the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. If the horizontal nystagmus provoked in above tests, the Roll test should be perform also to determine whether combining with HC- BPPV or not.</td>

	<td>To assess the long-term efficacy of canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) in the treatment of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Alternative theories for the pathophysiology of BPPV have been redefined in the past few years. CRP is considered to be the standard technique for its management. However, long-term follow-up results have been minimally reported in the literature. Five hundred ninety-two patients, 290 (49%) men and 302 (51%) women, were enrolled in this prospective study; their ages ranged from 18 to 84 (mean 59) years. At the time of their first examination, patients reported the duration of symptoms varied from 1 day to 18 months. Inclusion criteria were patient history compatible with BPPV and positive provocative maneuver (either Dix-Hallpike or Roll test). A variant of Epley and Barbeque maneuver was used. The Epley maneuver was used for posterior and anterior canal involvement, and "Barbeque roll" was used for horizontal canal involvement. Short-term follow-up was obtained 48 hours and 7 days after initial treatment, whereas long-term follow-up was obtained at repeated 6 month intervals. The posterior semicircular canal was involved in 521 (88%) patients treated, whereas the horizontal and anterior semicircular canals were involved in 59 (10%) and 12 (2%) patients, respectively. Symptoms subsided immediately in 497 (84%) patients. In 77 (13%) patients, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver remained positive after 48 hours, and CRP was performed again. Patients' mean follow-up was 46 months; 544 (92%) of 592 patients treated reported no symptoms of vertigo. Our data, based on long-term follow-up, suggest that CRP remains an efficient and long-lasting noninvasive treatment for BPPV.</td>

	<td>Horizontal canal (HC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HC-BPPV) is a vestibular disorder characterized by bouts of horizontal ocular nystagmus induced during reorientation of the head relative to gravity. The present report addresses the application of a morphologically descriptive 3-canal biomechanical model of the human membranous labyrinth to study gravity-dependent semicircular canal responses during this condition. The model estimates dynamic cupular and endolymph displacements elicited during HC-BPPV provocative diagnostic maneuvers and canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). The activation latencies in response to an HC-BPPV provocative diagnostic test were predicted to vary depending upon the initial location of the canalith debris (e.g. within the HC lumen vs. in the ampulla). Results may explain why the onset latency of ocular nystagmus evoked by the Dix-Hallpike provocative maneuver for posterior canal BPPV are typically longer than the latencies evoked by analogous tests for HC-BPPV. The model was further applied to assess the efficacy of a 360 degrees -rotation CRP for the treatment of canalithiasis HC-BPPV.</td>

A group of 61 patients underwent the maneuver, while a control group of 20 patients received no therapy. All patients were evaluated at 1 and 6 months. The percentage of patients who experienced subjective improvement was significantly higher in the treatment group at both 1 month (89% vs. 10%) and 6 months (92% vs. 50%). Three patients in the treatment group who did not improve after treatment underwent a second maneuver, and all achieved a positive result. In addition, 4 successfully treated patients experienced a recurrence between 1 and 6 months following treatment; 3 were retreated, and 2 of them responded well.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo, resulting from migration of otoconia into the semicircular canals. Several treatment methods involving positioning maneuvers that return the otoconia to the utricle have been described. Following treatment, most patients are provided with a variety of activity restrictions. Previous studies suggest that, overall, BPPV treatment may be successful without these restrictions. The purpose of this study was to determine the necessity of postmaneuver restrictions using an experimental and control group with participants matched for age, gender, involved ear, and symptoms. A canalith repositioning maneuver was used to treat the BPPV. During postmaneuver instruction, the 21 participants assigned to the restricted group were provided with typical activity restrictions. Twenty-one participants assigned to the nonrestricted group were given no postmaneuver restrictions. Only one participant in the restricted group and two participants in the nonrestricted group were not clear at the one-week follow-up appointment. Results indicated that postmaneuver restrictions do not improve treatment efficacy.</td>

One group had prior diagnosis of otologic disease (positive history group). No one in the second group had ever been diagnosed with otologic disease (negative history group). Caloric responses were retrospectively analyzed for the two groups. Patients with a positive history exhibited a greater prevalence of vestibulopathy than patients with a negative history. The positive history group, on average, also exhibited a larger unilateral weakness than those patients in the negative history group. We conclude that patients with BPPV and a history of otologic disease are more likely to present with vestibulopathy, than patients with BPPV and no history of otologic disease. This finding supports the benefit of complete vestibular evaluation in patients with BPPV to ensure comprehensive and successful treatment outcome.</td>

	<td>Free otoconia in the posterior semicircular canal (pSCC) are regarded as the main reason for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. We investigated the distribution of otoconia in the membranous labyrinth of guinea pigs (n = 34) after a defined rotatory/angular kinetic acceleration. The angular kinetic energy of the rotatory experiment produced a dislocation of the otoconia and sometimes of the complete gelatinous otolithic membrane of the utricular and saccular macula. The otoconia could be observed in all three semicircular canals but predominated in the dark cell areas of the utricular side of the lateral SCC. A total obstruction of the semicircular canal could never be seen. Close to the lateral crista, perilymphatic hemorrhage could frequently be observed. The saccular otoconia were located in the amalgamation between endolymphatic membrane and saccule. The results of this histological study can form the basis for different theories about the genesis of canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis and the vertigo which accompanies them.</td>

	<td>The incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) of the horizontal and superior semicircular canals is much less than that of BPPV due to affection of the posterior semicircular canal. Their diagnosis is however much more difficult and still prone to controversies. The provocative manoeuvre of the BPPV of the horizontal canal (BPPV-HSC) is the manoeuvre of rotation of the head in dorsal position. A horizontal positional nystagmus is obtained. There are two forms of BPPV-HSC: the geotropic form and the ageotropic form. In the geotropic form, the liberatory manoeuvre is a "barbecue" rotation of 180 with 360 degrees towards the healthy side. In the ageotropic form, there is no universal liberatory manoeuvre. Moreover as some cases of neurological aetiology have been recognized, it is not appropriate to apply ineffective manoeuvres. The BPPV of the superior canal (BPV-SSC) is very rare. The provocative manoeuvre is the Dix and Hallpike's manoeuvre. It causes positional torsional and vertical nystagmus with an opposite direction to that obtained for a BPPV of the contra-lateral posterior canal. The liberatory manoeuvre is a Semont manoeuvre, which is identical to that we would make for a contra-lateral BPPV of the posterior canal.</td>

	<td>According to the canalolithiasis theory, benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) is caused by gravity-dependent movements of otoconial debris that collects in the endolymph of the posterior semicircular canal. Other parts of the vestibular organ are rarely affected, and it is mainly the horizontal canal that is affected by this atypical form of BPPV. Canalolithiasis of the superior semicircular canal must be considered an anomaly because the superior semicircular canal is the highest point of the vestibular organ and debris normally cannot collect in this special location. Until now, BPPV of the superior canal has mainly been dealt with theoretically in the literature. The authors present three patients with canalolithiasis of the superior semicircular canal and offer direct proof of the condition using high-resolution 3D MRI.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent vestibular disorder and a most common cause of dizziness and vertigo. The modern canalolithiasis theory postulates the existence of free-floating dense otolithic particles in the endolymph of the posterior semicircular canal. The symptoms were exactly described by Dix and Hallpike; BPPV is normally a self-limited disease with spontaneous recovery. There is however a small number of patients who do not respond to any treatment or who present with otolithic vertigo which does not fit all Dix-Hallpike criteria (atypical BPPV). While BPPV in its typical appearance cannot be diagnosed with radiologic imaging, the authors succeeded in identifying structural changes in the vestibular organs of patients suffering from intractable or atypical BPPV using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging.</td>

Clinical symptoms prior to the procedure were noted. Twenty-nine of them were subjected to PRM, and postprocedural instructions were given to all patients. Various side effects during and following the procedure were recorded. They were classified into early and late based on the period and into major and minor based on severity. All patients were reviewed after 3 days, 7 days, and 1 month. Of the 29 patients, 19 patients (65.52%) had heaviness in the head, with 11 each (37.93%) reporting nausea and imbalance and 9 (31.03%) reporting instability during the procedure. A major complication, asystole, was noted in one patient. The percentage of side effects remained more or less the same in the early phase following the procedure. Only 5 of 29 patients were entirely asymptomatic. Ninety percent were relieved of symptoms by the end of 7 days, with no major complication recorded. PRM is an easy, effective, and relatively safe procedure. The risk of major complications with PRM, such as arrhythmias and asystole, highlights the need to consider other management modalities for BPPV in certain medically unfit patients.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is the illusion of motion, usually rotational motion. As patients age, vertigo becomes an increasingly common presenting complaint. The most common causes of this condition are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders. Less common causes include vertebrobasilar ischemia and retrocochlear tumors. The distinction between peripheral and central vertigo usually can be made clinically and guides management decisions. Most patients with vertigo do not require extensive diagnostic testing and can be treated in the primary care setting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo usually improves with a canalith repositioning procedure. Acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis improves with initial stabilizing measures and a vestibular suppressant medication, followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Meniere's disease often responds to the combination of a low-salt diet and diuretics. Vertiginous migraine headaches generally improve with dietary changes, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Vertigo associated with anxiety usually responds to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.</td>

The study will also evaluate the efficacy of complementary exercises for vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in BPPV, presenting with persistent vertigo or disequilibrium after performing therapeutic maneuvers. 175 patients from both sexes, were included in this analysis. All suffered from BPPV and were treated with therapeutic maneuvers, preferably that described by Semont (SM). One week after SM, 79% of patients were cured; 13% complained of disequilibrium or vertigo without BPPV, 3%, presented with a persistent positional vertigo without nystagmus during the Hallpike manoeuvre and 5% of the patients still complained from BPPV which in some cases got worse. For patients still complaining of imbalance or non-positional vertigo, customized VR programs were applied (optokinetic stimulations, rotatory chair, proprioceptive training and/or platform). The final results, evaluated by posturography and by DHI, were good. VR exercises can achieve improvement or cure in 16% of these patients.</td>

Retrospective review of 20 patients with LSC-BPPV (10 with geotropic and 10 with apogeotropic nystagmus) presenting to a tertiary balance center. Diagnosis was confirmed with infrared nystagmography in Dix-Hallpike positioning tests and supine positional tests. Patients were treated with one or more particle repositioning maneuvers. Addition of supine positional nystagmus tests to Dix-Hallpike positioning testing improves sensitivity in the diagnosis of LSC-BPPV. Treatment outcomes in the apogeotropic LSC-BPPV group were poorer than the geotropic LSC-BPPV group. Adding supine positional testing to routine vestibular diagnostic testing will increase the identification of LSC-BPPV. Apogeotropic LSC-BPPV is more challenging to treat.</td>

Source articles were identified by a MEDLINE search of English language sources before 2004 plus manual crosschecks of bibliographies from identified articles, selected national meeting abstracts, review article references, and textbook chapters. Each controlled trial that compared canalith repositioning patients to untreated control subjects in posterior canal benign positional vertigo (blinded and unblinded) was reviewed for inclusion. Data were abstracted systematically, scaled on validity and comparability, and cross-checked independently by another author. Studies were combined with fixed effects meta-analysis to estimate spontaneous resolution, 95% confidence intervals (CI) of effect size, and heterogeneity. Canalith repositioning is more effective than observation alone for the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, despite spontaneous resolution rates of one in three at 3 weeks. Public health implications are discussed, based on the high frequency of unrecognized BPPV reported in elderly patients, and the improvements after canalith repositioning in postural control and health-related quality of life (SF 36 Health Survey) documented in the literature.</td>

Patients completed the DHI before the onset of physical therapy intervention. A newly developed BPPV subscale developed from current DHI items was computed to determine whether the score could assist the practitioner in identifying individuals with BPPV. Individuals with BPPV had significantly higher mean scores on the newly developed BPPV subscale of the DHI (p < 0.01). The five-item BPPV score was a significant predictor of the likelihood of having BPPV (chi2 = 8.35; p < 0.01). On the two-item BPPV scale, individuals who had a score of 8 of 8 were 4.3 times more likely to have BPPV compared with individuals who had a score of 0.

A prospective controlled clinical study was designed in a tertiary referral center setting. The 62 participants included 17 healthy controls and 45 other subjects selected from patients who presented with the complaint of vertigo (25 diagnosed with BPPV and 20 diagnosed with Meniere's disease). The main outcome measures of VEMP were recorded in all subjects and findings in each patient group were compared with control findings. The VEMP for the 30 affected ears in the 25 BPPV patients revealed prolonged latencies in eight ears and decreased amplitude in one ear (nine abnormal ears; 30% of total). The recordings for the 20 affected ears in the Meniere's disease patients revealed four ears with no response, six ears with prolonged latencies (ten abnormal ears; 50% of total). Only two (5.9%) of the 34 control ears had abnormal VEMP. The rate of VEMP abnormalities in the control ears was significantly lower than the corresponding rates in the affected BPPV ears and the affected Meniere's ears that were studied (P=0.012 and P<0.001, respectively). The results suggest that testing of VEMP is a promising method for diagnosing and following patients with BPPV paroxysmal positional vertigo and Meniere's disease. Further investigations with this method in other neurotologic pathologies might also be informative.</td>

Positional maneuvers were systematically performed in the plane of the posterior canal (PC; Dix-Hallpike maneuver) and the horizontal canal (HC; patients were rolled to either side in a supine position) on 490 consecutive patients essentially referred for vertigo and/or gait unsteadiness. One hundred patients (20%) presented positional nystagmus. This nystagmus had a peripheral origin in 83 patients, including 80 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In BPPV, the PC was involved in 61 patients, the HC in 18 patients (geotropic horizontal nystagmus in 11 and ageotropic in 7; changing from geotropic to ageotropic or the reverse in 4 patients), and both the PC and HC in 1 patient. There was evidence of central positional nystagmus in 12 patients, including positional downbeat nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver in 7 patients with various neurologic disorders, and ageotropic horizontal nystagmus during the HC maneuver in 2 patients with, respectively, cerebellar ischemia and definite migrainous vertigo. The peripheral or central origin of the positional nystagmus could not be ascertained in 5 patients, including 1 patient with probable migrainous vertigo and another with possible anterior canal BPPV. A rotatory-upbeat nystagmus in the context of PC BPPV, a horizontal nystagmus, whether geotropic or ageotropic, due to HC BPPV, and a positional downbeat nystagmus related to various central disorders are the 3 most common types of positional nystagmus. Geotropic horizontal positional nystagmus and, most certainly, horizontal positional nystagmus changing from geotropic to ageotropic or the reverse point to HC BPPV. In contrast, an ageotropic horizontal positional nystagmus that is not changing (from ageotropic to geotropic) may indicate a central lesion.</td>

	<td>The high coincidence of organic vestibular and somatoform vertigo syndromes has appeared to support pathogenic models showing a strong linkage between them. It was hypothesised that a persisting vestibular dysfunction causes the development of anxiety disorders. To determine the relation between vestibular deficits and somatoform vertigo disorders in an interdisciplinary prospective study. Participants were divided into eight diagnostic groups: healthy volunteers (n=26) and patients with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV, n=11), vestibular neuritis (n=11), Menière's disease (n=7), vestibular migraine (n=15), anxiety (n=23), depression (n=12), or somatoform disorders (n=22). Neuro-otological diagnostic procedures included electro-oculography with rotatory and caloric testing, orthoptic examination with measurements of subjective visual vertical (SVV) and ocular torsion, and a neurological examination. Psychosomatic diagnostic procedures comprised interviews and psychometric instruments. Patients with BPPV (35.3%) and with vestibular neuritis (52.2%) had pathological test values on caloric irrigation (p<0.001). Otolith dysfunction with pathological tilts of SVV and ocular torsion was found only in patients with vestibular neuritis (p<0.001). Patients with Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, and psychiatric disorders showed normal parameters for vestibular testing but pathological values for psychometric measures. There was no correlation between pathological neurological and pathological psychometric parameters. High anxiety scores are not a result of vestibular deficits or dysfunction. Patients with Menière's disease and vestibular migraine but not vestibular deficits showed the highest psychiatric comorbidity. Thus the course of vertigo syndromes and the possibility of a pre-existing psychopathological personality should be considered pathogenic factors in any linkage between organic and psychometric vertigo syndromes.</td>

None. Otolith function was assessed with estimation of the subjective visual vertical and analysis of the torsional otolith-ocular reflex. Unilateral stimulation of the utricle was performed on a rotator that allowed eccentric lateral displacement of the patient during earth-vertical rotation with constant velocity. The otolith-ocular reflex was recorded with three-dimensional video-oculography. There was no difference in the estimation of the subjective visual vertical between patients and controls. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the otolith-ocular reflex torsional eye position was smaller in patients than in the control group. The gain of the unilateral otolith-ocular reflex was reduced in patients on both sides on first testing. After several weeks, only the affected labyrinth showed a reduced otolith-ocular reflex gain. Our findings document otolith dysfunction in patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo possibly secondary to degeneration of the utricular macula. This finding may account for the transient mild imbalance and dizziness that some patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo experience even after resolution of positional vertigo.</td>

H-SCC BPPV with geotropic nystagmus is more common. H-SCC BPPV can coexist with ipsilateral P-SCC BPPV. However, in some cases of H-SCC BPPV, Dix-Hallpike maneuver can cause vertigo and horizontal nystagmus. This may be confused with P-SCC BPPV.

	<td>One of the problems in the management of horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV) is the difficulty in determining the affected ear using Ewald's second law. The purpose of this study is to develop the new "bow and lean test (BLT)" to easily determine the affected ear of HSC-BPPV and evaluate its efficiency. We compared the efficiency between the classic method and BLT in 26 patients with HSC-BPPV. The classic method is based on Ewald's second law comparing the intensity of nystagmus or symptoms in the head roll test. BLT is based on the direction of both "bowing nystagmus" and "leaning nystagmus" at the head's bowing and leaning state in a sitting position. The affected ear is the same direction of bowing nystagmus in canalolithiasis and the same direction of leaning nystagmus in cupulolithiasis. In 26 patents (15 canalolithiasis, 11 cupulolithiasis), 3 (11.5%) patients did not show a prominent affected ear in the classic method, and 7 (26.9%) patients showed the different affected ear between the two methods. All 10 patients were successfully treated with just one trial of barbecue rotation based on the affected ear in BLT. Three patients did not show any bowing or leaning nystagmus. The side with canal paresis in all four patients, who showed significant canal paresis in bithermal caloric tests, was equal to the affected ear based on BLT. The "bow and lean test" (also called "Choung's test") is a new method that can easily determine the affected ear of HC-BPPV.</td>

We have studied retrospectively 8 patients with BPPV-HC and positive head rotation manoeuvre registered by EOG techniques. Possible alterations in other EOG tests in the group of patients were analyzed. Most of the patients (7/8) expressed bilateral horizontal geotropic changing-direction nystagmus. One patient exhibited apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus. 5/8 cases showed caloric hypofunction. We have proven that BPPV-HC is an uncommon disorder. In most of the cases, provocative manoeuver generates bilateral horizontal geotropic changing-direction nystagmus that probably is due to canalitiasis of the horizontal semicircular canal. The rest, a few cases, exhibit apogeotropic horizontal response that can be secondary to cupulolitiasis or location particles in the anterior portion of the horizontal canal. A caloric test showed abnormal in many and can help to locatize the affected ear.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can be produced by specific manoeuvres and be studied by electrooculography (EOG). It allows an exhaustive study of features in the positional nystagmus. Although most of the patients with BPPV express typical nystagmus, there exists a group of them that exhibit a non typical form. In this work, a comparative study was carried out between two groups of patients. We have studied retrospectively 145 patients with BPPV and Dix-Hallpicke (D-H) positive manoeuvre registered by EOG techniques. All patients were explored in a complete EOG tests. Two groups were identified: typical response/atypical response according to the features of nystagmus response. Possible alterations in other EOG tests in each group were investigated and differences between both types of response were analyzed. 83.5% of cases showed typical nystagmus and atypical in the rest. Other EOG alterations observed in these patients, were (group typical response/atypical response): caloric hypofunction (17.3%/23%), positional nystagmus (12.4%/62.5%), alterations in visual-oculomotor function tests (10%/50%). Frequent alterations were observed in the classic manoeuvres and also in the rest of EOG tests. Probably atypical response in the first is due to or can explain the existence of the second.</td>

	<td>Vertigo in childhood is a complaint consisting of a wide spectrum of diagnoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate pediatric patients with vertigo with normal eardrum and middle ear findings and discuss the differential diagnoses. Patient records of 50 children under 18 years of age with vertigo as the chief complaint, examined at the Baskent University, Research and Application Centers at Konya and Adana otorhinolaryngology clinics between May 2003 and October 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. The questionnaires, laboratory tests including blood samples, audiological and vestibular tests, and final diagnoses were analyzed. Patients with perforated eardrums, otitis media with effusion, and acute upper respiratory tract infections were not included in the study. The study group consisted of 50 patients (33 females, 66%; 17 males, 34%), between 4 and 17 years of age (mean age, 11.5+/-3.9 years). Severe sensorineural hearing loss was present in one patient unilaterally (2%) and one patient bilaterally (2%). Bilateral low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss was present in one patient (2%). Electronystagmography revealed central vestibular abnormalities in three patients (6%). Canal paresis was established in six patients (12%). The Dix-Hallpike test was positive in six patients (12%). The most frequent cause of vertigo was migraine, occurring in 34% of patients (n=17). Other less-frequent etiologies of vertigo were benign paroxysmal vertigo (n=6; 12%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (n=6; 12%), psychogenic vertigo (n=5; 10%), epilepsy (n=3; 6%), metabolic disorders (n=3; 6%), vestibular neuritis (n=2; 4%), Meniere's disease (n=1; 2%), perilymphatic fistula (n=1; 2%), amblyopia (n=1; 2%), and unclassifiable (n=5; 10%). Migraine was found to be the most frequent presenting diagnosis in childhood vertigo, although several peripheral vestibular disorders also were diagnosed. Evaluation of vertigo in childhood should begin with a thorough neuro-otologic evaluation and include other relevant multidisciplinary team members as needed to avoid unnecessary effort and cost.</td>

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness are common symptoms in the general population. While the clinical picture is well known and widely described, there are different interpretations of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. The purpose of this case report was to describe the treatment of a 56 year old woman with complains of positional vertigo for 35 consecutive years. She suffered from a sudden onset of rotatory, unilateral horizontal canal type benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The symptoms started a day after falling from a bus, where she injured her head. Otherwise her medical history was unremarkable. She was treated with an individualized home exercise program of eye movement exercises, Brandt/Daroff exercises, and general conditioning exercises (i.e., laying on the left side from sitting on the bed, while the head rotated 45 degrees to the right, waiting for about one minute; twice a day on gradual basis, not laying on the side all the way, but to use enough pillows to lay about at 60 degrees). Four weeks from the start of physical therapy, the patient was free of symptoms, even when her neck was in the extended position.</td>

Activity restriction was significantly greater in patients that have already had two and more falls, when compared with those who had fallen only once (p=0.031). We found a significant association between the number of falls and their causes (p<0.001). Falls that have happened by slipping were more frequent in the elderly that reported one fall (p=0.0265) and falls that had happened because of dizziness were more frequent in the elderly that complained of two or more falls (p=0.0012). Fear and tendency to fall are referred by the majority of chronically dizzy elderly. Fall are more frequent in the morning, in the home and during walking. The propulsion direction is mentioned by half of the elderly and the most common cause for falls are dizziness and stumbling. The number of falls is significantly associated with activity restrictions after the last fall and with the causes for falling (slipping and dizziness).</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a high-prevalence vestibular end-organ disorder caused by the detachment of utricular otoconia which float in the posterior or lateral semicircular canal. In the majority of cases the etiology of BPPV is unknown and it may follow viral infection, vascular disorders or head trauma. BPPV may be recurrent, with some authors demonstrating a correlation between recurrence and female gender. We report herein on ten cases (out of 289 diagnoses of BPPV) of recurrent idiopathic BPPV, occurring in healthy women receiving oral contraceptive treatment, which ceased after treatment suspension. It has been hypothesized that the impaired water and electrolyte balance, the variations of endolymphatic pH and the impairment of glucose or lipid metabolism induced by oral contraceptive treatment may cause otoconial degeneration and subsequent otoconia detachment and BPPV. The rarity of the finding (10/289) could account for the poor attention paid to the hormonal pathogenesis of BPPV.</td>

	<td>The identification of the affected ear is crucial for the successful treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the horizontal canal (HC-BPPV) by using particle-repositioning maneuvers. To determine the lateralizing value of lying-down nystagmus in HC-BPPV. The authors prospectively investigated lying-down nystagmus in 152 consecutive patients with confirmed HC-BPPV (99 geotropic and 53 apogeotropic types). Lying-down nystagmus was induced by placing patients in a supine position. For the geotropic type of HC-BPPV, the affected ear was identified by assuming that nystagmus is more intense when the head is rotated to the affected side while supine. The reverse assumption was adopted for the apogeotropic type. Lying-down nystagmus was observed in 58 patients (38.2%), 36 (36.4%) of the geotropic and 22 (41.5%) of the apogeotropic type. The direction of lying-down nystagmus was mostly away from the affected ear in the geotropic type, but toward the affected ear in the apogeotropic type. Of the 16 geotropic patients in whom the affected ear was not identified initially, 7 with lying-down nystagmus showed resolution of vertigo after particle-repositioning maneuvers when the involved ear was identified by observing lying-down nystagmus. Lying-down nystagmus is a valuable sign for determining which ear is affected in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the horizontal canal, especially when patients show symmetric nystagmus on turning the head to either side.</td>

When left Dix-Hallpike maneuver was performed, she showed a positional nystagmus of which fast phase direction of the torsional component was clockwise while that of the vertical component was downward. We plotted the slow phase eye velocity of the positional nystagmus during the left Dix-Hallpike maneuver on three-dimensional coordinates that showed the axis of the positional nystagmus to be perpendicular to the plane of the right ASCC.

	<td>From April 2001 to November 2003, we investigated 8 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that was suspected to simultaneously affect both the horizontal and posterior semicircular canals (HSCC and PSCC). These cases showed typical vertical-torsional nystagmus induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, followed by a horizontal nystagmus. They also showed a direction-changing geotropic or apogeotropic positional nystagmus triggered by lateral head rotations in the supine position. Using the three-dimensional analysis of the positional nystagmus, the rotation axis of the positional nystagmus had a component perpendicular to the plane of PSCC and another component perpendicular to the plane of HSCC. All these findings suggest that BPPV in these patients was a combination of posterior and horizontal canal BPPV. The observation of a vertical-torsional positional nystagmus should prompt the specialist to perform not only the canalith repositioning procedure, but also to execute lateral head turns in the supine position.</td>

	<td>This study was aimed to experimentally investigate the effect of returned otoconia on the utricular using isolated utricles. The effect of interposed otoconia in models of canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis were also investigated using isolated posterior semicircular canal (PSC). Bullfrogs were used. The utricles (Experiment I) and PSC (Experiment II) were removed in Ringer solution. Experiment I-a: The otoconia were carefully removed from the utricular macula with gentle flush of Ringer solution. Before and after the otoconial removal, sinusoidal rotatory stimulation (0.1 Hz, 135 degrees ) was given to record utricular compound action potentials (CAPs). Experiment I-b: (1) Instantaneous changes in the utricular potentials when the otoconial mass was positioned on the macula were recorded. (2) Utricular CAP changes in response to sinusoidal rotation immediately and 10 min after the otoconial positioning were recorded. Experiment II: PSC CAPs due to sinusoidal rotatory stimulation in normal specimen, canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis models were recorded. Experiment I-a: The utricular CAPs in response to sinusoidal rotation showed sinusoidal oscillation. However, this oscillation disappeared after the otoconial removal. Experiment I-b: (1) The utricular potentials transiently increased for 3-4 s after positioning the otoconial mass. (2) The utricular CAPs increased in seven specimens and decreased in four. Ten minutes after the CAPs were almost the same as immediately after otoconial positioning. Experiment II: In cupulolithiasis model, the PSC CAPs decreased in all specimens. The otoconia played an essential role as a transducer of acceleration to the utricular macula. Otoconia returned to the utricular macula change utricular reactivity and hence are the possible cause of dizziness after physical therapy. PSC responses to sinusoidal rotation were suppressed in cupulolithiasis model.</td>

The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in otoconial morphology in rats according to age, using FESEM. Laboratory study using experimental animals. We investigated age-related changes in otoconial morphology using FESEM in three groups of rats: young (1 wk old), middle-aged (6 mo old), and aged (23 mo old). There was great size variation in utricular otoconia in the young and aged rats, but we found no clear regional separation of saccular otoconia in all groups based on size. In the oldest rats, the bodies of many otoconia in both maculae were pitted, fissured, penetrated, and eventually broken into several fragments. However, the terminal facets were smooth and the lines of intersection of facets were sharp, despite the degenerated bodies of the otoconia in this group. Giant otoconia were discovered frequently on the outer margin of the utricular maculae in aged rats. We directly observed weakened or broken linking filaments and otoconial fragments in the aged group. The oldest rats showed the most degeneration of otoconia and linking filaments with otoconial fragments. This study of age-related morphologic changes in otoconia might help us understand the origin of idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is characterized by horizontal direction-changing nystagmus induced by lateral head turning in supine position. According to Ewald's second law, the direction of head turning that creates a stronger response represents the affected side in geotropic nystagmus and the healthy side in apogeotropic nystagmus. However, it may not always be possible to lateralize the involved ear only by comparing the intensity of the nystagmus. We studied the values of nystagmus induced by position change from sitting to supine in the lateralization of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A retrospective study of 54 patients who had been diagnosed as having horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo at the Dizziness Clinic of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from May 2003 to February 2004 was performed. The directions of the nystagmus induced by lying down were compared with those determined by Ewald's second law. Of the 54 patients, 32 (20 apogeotropic and 12 geotropic) showed horizontal nystagmus induced by lying down. The nystagmus tended to be ipsilesional in apogeotropic patients (80%) and contralesional in their geotropic counterparts (75%). In horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, lying-down nystagmus mostly beats toward the involved ear in the apogeotropic type and directs to the healthy ear in the geotropic type. The direction of lying-down nystagmus may help lateralizing the involved ear in horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

The appropriate CRP was performed, depending on the type of BPPV. Prognostic factors studied included age, sex, aetiology, duration of disease, abnormal electronystagmographic findings, canal involvement, improper performance of manoeuvres, response on first or repeat treatment, and presence of recurrences. One hundred and fifty-five patients were studied, 66 men and 89 women, with mean ages of 58.7 and 60.4 years, respectively. Age and the involvement of two canals or bilateral disease had an effect on initial treatment outcome and were correlated to increased recurrences but not to repeat treatment outcome. Secondary BPPV, abnormal electronystagmographic findings and improper performance of manoeuvres had a significant effect both on initial and repeat treatment, but not on recurrences. Sex and duration of symptoms had no effect. Canalith repositioning procedures provide fast and long-lasting treatment of BPPV in most patients.

	<td>Intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is rare, and surgery is indicated in only a very small number of cases. Transcanal singular neurectomy is considered a difficult and risky procedure possibly leading to hearing loss and vertigo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the singular neurectomy through the external ear canal in an attempt to explain the contradictory results of previous reports of anatomists and of surgeons who abandoned the technique, considering that the singular neurectomy could not be reached via the external auditory canal without damaging the labyrinth. Anatomical study on 100 halves of human heads in which the canal of the singular nerve (SN) was identified and opened at its extremities, the internal auditory canal and the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, via a posterior fossa approach. Next, the canal of the SN was dissected via the external auditory canal, at the floor of the round window (RW) niche. The relation of the SN canal to the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal was evaluated. In 90 cases, the canal was transected medially to and away from the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, and in 8, at its emergence from the posterior ampullary recess. In these 98 cases, the RW membrane and the bony labyrinth were kept intact. In two cases, the canal of the SN could not be reached at the floor of the RW niche. Singular neurectomy is feasible via the external auditory canal, without damaging the RW membrane or the labyrinth in 98% of the cases. Because singular neurectomy is indicated in a very small number of cases, it is difficult to master this particular surgical procedure. This may explain why most surgeons abandoned the technique after a few attempts, followed by an unacceptable rate of sensorineural hearing loss.</td>

	<td>Gerontological nurses play a critical role in the early recognition of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a condition that accounts for approximately 50% of vertigo in older adults. BPPV results in vertigo when debris collects in one or more of the semicircular canals, most typically the posterior canal. It may be differentiated from other forms of vertigo because it results in dizziness when recumbent or with head position changes. BPPV may be successfully treated with repositioning therapy, such as the Epley maneuver. Nurses working in medical offices, longterm care facilities, and assisted living may be called on to perform this maneuver. Gerontological nurses play a key role in assessing and treating BPPV, therefore minimizing unnecessary testing and medication and reducing the suffering and expense for patients with this condition.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease cause most cases of vertigo; however, family physicians must consider other causes including cerebrovascular disease, migraine, psychological disease, perilymphatic fistulas, multiple sclerosis, and intracranial neoplasms. Once it is determined that a patient has vertigo, the next task is to determine whether the patient has a peripheral or central cause of vertigo. Knowing the typical clinical presentations of the various causes of vertigo aids in making this distinction. The history (i.e., timing and duration of symptoms, provoking factors, associated signs and symptoms) and physical examination (especially of the head and neck and neurologic systems, as well as special tests such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver) provide important clues to the diagnosis. Associated neurologic signs and symptoms, such as nystagmus that does not lessen when the patient focuses, point to central (and often more serious) causes of vertigo, which require further work-up with selected laboratory and radiologic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging.</td>

The study also compares the features of the Epley maneuver and the Semont maneuver and correlates them to the 360-degree maneuver. A prospective analysis of 31 patients presenting with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who were treated using the multiaxial positioning device. A questionnaire was administered immediately after each treatment. The study was carried out in a private practice referral clinic for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Subjects consisted of 31 adults who ranged in age from 44 to 95 years. Thirty-one patients were treated using the 360-degree maneuver. A multiaxial positioning device was used to rotate patients completely upside down and back into the starting position in the proper plane. Subjective improvement scores, tolerability, objective nystagmus observations, and complications were recorded. Subjective improvement rates were 90% after one treatment; 97% were symptom-free and nystagmus-free after a maximum of three treatment sessions. Eighty-seven percent found the procedure quite tolerable from an ergonomic standpoint. The 360-degree maneuver can be effective in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Its rate of success is comparable to the rate of success of the standard Epley maneuver. On analysis, it is strikingly similar to the Epley and Semont maneuvers.</td>

The HART with eyes fixation was performed 3 times to determine its reliability. Gain, asymmetry and phase for the vertical VOR respectively. A statistical analysis was carried out to determine the test reliability and the number of individuals with an abnormal result. Gain is the only variable that showed a reproducible result in the HART for the active head movement at 1-2 Hz (test-retest reliability 0.83-0.89). The values of gain showed a moderate correlation at the frequencies 1-3 Hz (correlation 0.60-0.87). Asymmetry and phase were not reproducible variables (correlation < 0.55). Thirteen of 27 (48%) patients presented a decrease of the vertical gain, another 13 showed normal values and one case showed raised values. Gain is the only useful variable in the vertical HART. Forty-eight percent of patients with posterior canal BPPV have a reduced vertical gain, suggesting an impairment of inferior vestibular nerve function.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and video-oculographic findings in patients with anterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This is a prospective case series. The study was set at an outpatient clinic in a general hospital. Fourteen individuals with symptoms of BPPV and positional downbeating nystagmus (pDBN) were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on a history of brief episodes of vertigo and the presence of pDBN confirmed in the video-oculographic examination during Dix-Hallpike test (DH) or head-hanging maneuver. Patients were treated by particle repositioning maneuver and the effectiveness was evaluated at 7, 30, and 180 days posttreatment. The treatment was repeated up to 4 times if pDBN was persistent. The main outcome measure is the number of patients without pDBN at 30 and 180 days. Video-oculography showed a predominant pDBN in response to DH. Of the 14 patients, 7 had arterial hypertension, and 5 of 14 cases presented abnormalities on the caloric test. Horizontal spontaneous nystagmus was found in 3 of 14 individuals. Positional nystagmus at different positional test was observed in 5 of 14 individuals, suggesting the involvement of several canals. Of the 14 patients, 10 (71%) did not present vertigo, and the positional tests were negative at 30 days. However, 3 cases presented a positive DH with persistence of BPPV episodes and pDBN at 30 days, and another developed a contralateral posterior canal affectation. One of the patients maintained a persistent pDBN at 180 days despite the repeated maneuvers. Video-oculography demonstrates that anterior canal BPPV is characterized by a predominant downbeating nystagmus in response to DH. These individuals may show alterations in the vestibular caloric, and they can have multicanal affectation.</td>

	<td>Causes of benign episodic vertigo in paediatric age include benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPV) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The aim is to review the clinical, audiological and vestibular findings in a cohort of children with BPV and in a group of children with BPPV and to highlight the differences useful to formulating a differential diagnosis. Eighteen children, aged 4-9 years, consecutively examined for paroxysmal attacks of dizziness and/or vertigo attacks between January 2002 and December 2002 entered our study. The clinical characteristics of vertigo, presence of triggering factors, family history of migraine, presence of motion sickness, migraine and other accompanying symptoms were considered. Neurological, ophthalmologic, vestibular and auditory functions were assessed. Eight children suffered from BPPV and ten children from BPV. In the BPPV group, the vestibular examination was normal except for the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Liberatory maneuvers were immediately effective in all patients and all remained symptom-free during the follow-up. In the BPV group, the vestibular examination was positive in 3 patients but none had positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver. All patients with BPV have a positive family history of migraine and seven had a history of motion sickness. In all, migraine was present one year before the vertigo symptoms, with a frequency of at least two migraine episodes a month. BPV differs from BPPV in terms of family history, clinical symptoms, otoneurological signs, therapy and clinical evolution. BPPV is characterized by specific otoneurological signs, and must be treated with liberatory maneuvers: neither medical therapy nor strict follow-up is needed.</td>

	<td>Within the poorly understood mechanisms implicated in the aetiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the results of this trial provide clinical evidence of a potential role of emotional stress connected to adverse life events as a trigger of otoconial dysfunction. High levels of anxiety, depression and somatization were recorded and considered psychogenic precursors of BPPV, thus emphasizing the role of psychological distress in precipitating peripheral vestibular disorders. Therefore, appraisal of life stress and psychological attitudes may have potential implications in the clinical assessment of this labyrinthine vertigo and its frequent relapses. BPPV is one of the most common peripheral vestibular disorders, and although it has been the subject of several studies and debates, its aetiology still remains unknown in most cases. Because it has been shown that emotional stress is related to the onset or worsening of other inner ear dysfunctions such as Ménière's disease and sudden hearing loss, this study investigated the hypothesis that life events, mood and psychological attitudes may have a causal relationship with BPPV. Fifty patients (40 females and 10 men; mean age 43.5+/-10.1 years, range 30-65 years) were recruited and compared with 50 healthy volunteers matched for sex, age and socio-demographic variables. Patients were selected among dizzy patients who were referred to the ENT Clinic of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia from the emergency unit with a primary diagnosis of 'positional vertigo' and enrolled in the study only if they had a paroxysmal positional nystagmus as diagnosed by Dix-Hallpike and Semont's manoeuvres. Patients with a history of recurrent vertigo and additional otoneurological diseases were excluded. The Paykel Life Events Scale, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Symptom Check List-90 Revisited and Hamilton Depression Scale were the psychometric questionnaires used to complete the audiological and vestibular examinations. Patients with BPPV reported significantly more life events than control subjects in the year preceding the onset of vertigo (p<0.005). Negative life events, objective negative impact and a poor degree of control were also significantly more frequent in patients compared with controls (p<0.005). There were no significant differences between groups concerning positive life events (p>0.05). Psychometric questionnaires recorded significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and somatization in the pathological sample (p<0.005), as well as an increased obsessive-compulsive attitude (p<0.05).</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is characterized by episodic vertigo and nystagmus provoked by head motions. To study the characteristics of BPPV in a large group of patients in Korea, we retrospectively analyzed clinical features of 1,692 patients (women: 1,146, 67.7%; men: 54.6, 32.3%; mean age: 54.8+/-14.0 yr), who had been diagnosed as BPPV by trained neuro-otologists Dizziness Clinics. The diagnosis of BPPV was based on typical nystagmus elicited by positioning maneuvers. Posterior semicircular canal was involved in 60.9% of the patients, horizontal canal in 31.9%, anterior canal in 2.2%, and mixed canals in 5.0%. The horizontal canal type of BPPV (HC-BPPV) comprised 49.5% of geotropic and 50.5% of apogeotropic types. We could observe significant negative correlation between the proportion of HC-BPPV of each clinic and the mean time interval between the symptom onset and the first visit to the clinics (r=-0.841, p<0.05). Most patients were successfully treated with canalith repositioning maneuvers (86.9%). The high incidence of HC-BPPV in this study may be explained by relatively shorter time interval between the symptom onset and visit to the Dizziness Clinics in Korea, compared with previous studies in other countries.</td>

	<td>The complaint of dizziness can be caused by a variety of disorders affecting central or peripheral vestibular system. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It is a syndrom characterized by short-lasted episodes of true vertigo, induced by a rapid head position change and associated with a positional, transient nystagmus. It is classically identified by the Dix-Hallpike test. Vestibular and audiology function tests are usually normal. Patient is succesfully treated with physical maneuvres (Canalith Repositioning Procedure CRP). This raport presents eight patients (four are described in details) suffered from BPPV-PSC, hospitalized in the Department of Phoniatric and Audiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Methods include laryngologic examination, audiology and vestibular tests, Dix-Hallpike'a maneuver. All patients presented characteristic history and results of performed diagnostic tests. The efficacy of physical maneuvers were confirmed. BPPV is usually easy to diagnose and physical maneuvers are very effective.</td>

	<td>Bilateral benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (bBPPV) is rather rare, accounting for up to 10% in the reported benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) series. Inappropriate head positioning during testing in unilateral BPPV causes the otolith debris in the uppermost ear to move toward the cupula, resulting in an inhibitory nystagmus and mimicking bBPPV. We analyzed the clinical data of patients with bilaterally positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and compared them with the characteristics of patients with unilateral BPPV. We further tried to propose a simple schematic approach to the treatment of patients with bilaterally positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Medical records of 232 patients treated for BPPV at our dizziness clinic during 1999 to 2003 were reviewed. An algorithm used for the treatment of patients with bilaterally positive BPPV is discussed. Twenty-eight patients with bilaterally positive Dix-Hallpike test were found. Sixteen were diagnosed with bBPPV, and 12 were diagnosed with unilateral mimicking bBPPV. Thirty patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV served as control subjects. No difference in age, sex distribution, duration of symptoms, number of treatments per ear, and recurrence was found between bBPPV and unilateral BPPV. The female sex appeared to be predisposed for more treatments. The total duration of BPPV symptoms obtained by history was found to correlate with the number of recurrences after treatment. We conclude that bBPPV can be readily distinguished from unilateral mimicking bBPPV. Patients with bBPPV do not differ from patients with unilateral BPPV in clinical characteristics. The mechanism of otolith debris dislodgment appears to be the main cause of bilaterality, trauma being a more common trigger than other known causes of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Existing treatment maneuvers for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC-BPPV) include the Semont liberatory maneuver (SLM) and canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM). Independent investigations reveal that these maneuvers provide an excellent outcome for most patients. However, certain aspects of these maneuvers, such as hyperextension of the neck for CRM and brisk lateral motion for the SLM, are contraindicated for patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency, cervical spondylosis, back problems, and so forth. A hybrid approach, the Gans repositioning maneuver (GRM) was developed for use with these patients. The purpose of this project was to assess efficacy of the GRM for treatment of PC-BPPV. Two-hundred seven participants were enrolled in this prospective study. All participants were treated with the GRM. Six different clinicians performed the treatments. Participants returned for follow-up at one-week intervals until it was determined that the PC-BPPV was clear. On average, 1.25 GRM treatments were required to resolve the PC-BPPV. The majority of the participants (80.2%) were cleared with one GRM treatment, and 95.6% were clear after two treatments. Recurrence rate was 5%. There was no difference in outcome based on clinician. The GRM is an efficacious treatment maneuver for PC-BPPV and may be preferential for use in patients with neck, back, hip, and/or mobility issues that contraindicate the use of SLM or CRM.</td>

Such an approach is essential because of the difference in intervention between the two disorders in question. Results from evaluation of the case study presented here revealed a persistent ageotropic positional nystagmus consistent with MPV or a cupulolithiasis variant of HC-BPPV. The patient was treated with liberatory maneuvers to remove possible otoconial debris from the horizontal canal in an attempt, in turn, to provide further diagnostic information. There was no change in symptoms following treatment for HC-BPPV. This case was diagnosed subsequently as MPV, and the patient was referred for medical intervention. Treatment has been successful for 22 months. Incorporation of HC-BPPV treatment, therefore, may provide useful information in the differential diagnosis of MPV and the cupulolithiasis variant of HC-BPPV.</td>

Dix-Hallpike maneuver, dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), and a specific PSCO questionnaire (PCOQ) were used to measure outcome. Twenty-eight patients underwent PSCO. The mean follow-up time was 40 months. All patients had normalization of the Hallpike test. DHI scores of 20 patients were recorded. The mean preoperative score was 70 compared with postoperative mean of 13 (P < 0.001). Mild hearing loss was found in 1 patient. PSCO is highly successful. The DHI scores postoperatively show significant improvement. The PCOQ revealed an overall 85% patient satisfaction rate. PSCO is a safe and effective intervention for intractable BPPV with a high patient satisfaction rate. C-4.</td>

	<td>Postural stability maintenance was investigated in patients with "idiopathic" benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal (BPPV-PSC) and compared to healthy subjects. To measure the postural stability during a quiet upright stance, we used static posturography in two conditions: with open and with closed eyes. The effect of the repositioning Epley's maneuver on the recovery of postural stability in patients with different durations of BPPV-PSC less than 60 days after the first attack of positioning vertigo (group I) and more than 60 days (group II) was examined. The investigation was made 1 h after the positive Dix-Hallpike test and 7 days after treatment with the Epley maneuver. "Sway velocity" (SV) and "relative power spectrum" (RPS) of the stabilograms were calculated to evaluate the postural stability for each subject and each experimental condition. We found a pronounced spectral density peak in the frequency range of 1.0-2.0 Hz and smaller spectral density in the range of 0.15-0.5 Hz compared to that in healthy subjects. Our results showed that the postural maintenance in BPPV-PSC patients depended on the disease duration. Patients with a duration of BPPV symptoms less than 60 days after the first attack demonstrated a high dependence on the visual input for postural stability. One week after the Epley maneuver, differences in the recovery of postural control in both groups of patients were also found. We assume that the disturbed otolith function together with the impaired dynamics of the semicircular canal generate a particular pattern of postural maintenance. The different degree of restoration of postural stability 1 week after the EM treatment in BPPV-PSC patients with different durations of the disease gives us reason to believe that after removing the otoconia from the semicircular canal, some stimulation of other sensory subsystems and adaptation mechanisms occur that lead to a new pattern of postural maintenance.</td>

There are several approaches for treatment, but efficacy is still being discussed. To asses the effectiveness of the specific maneuvers available to the treatment of BPPV. An electronic search at the main databases, including MEDLINE, LILACS, PEDro, Cochrane Collaborations Database was performed, and we selected only randomized clinical trials studying adults with diagnosis of BPPV confirmed by the Dix-Hallpike test. The trials should have included physical maneuvers such as Epley and Semont. The main outcome was Dix-Hallpike negative test and the changes to subjective complaints. The trials were assessed using Jadad's scale and only studies with quality scores equal or above 3 were pooled on a meta-analyses to assess their effectiveness. We found five controlled clinical trials phase I comparing the Epley's maneuver with controls or placebo. The meta-analysis showed positive evidence of Epley's maneuver to the posterior semicircular canal (effect size = 0.11 [CI 95% 0.05, 0.26] of objective improvement [Dix-Halpike] within one week, 0.24 [CI 95% 0.13, 0.45] within one month and 0.16 [CI 95% 0.08, 0.33] of improvement reported by the patients within one week.

The positive rate of these otologic function test were analyzed. Primary BPPV comprised 82 percent (70/86) of patients with BPPV. Among all of the patients, the results of pure tone audiometry were abnormal in 52 percent (45/86) of the cases. High frequency auditory brainstem response (ABR) was abnormal in 60 percent (30/50) of cases. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) was abnormal in 34 percent (11/32) of cases who had this examination. And bithermal caloric test were abnormal in 28 percent (20/72) of cases. In the abnormal cases, 67 percent (12/18) of cases were ipsilateral with BPPV. The majority of the BPPV with abnormal results of bithermal caloric test (89%, 16/18) belong to posterior semicircular canal BPPV. The incidence of primary BPPV was higher than that of secondary BPPV. The abnormality in superior labyrinth was much more correlated with the occurrence of BPPV. The inner ear ischemia might be a factor in the morbidity of BPPV, especially for the primary BPPV.</td>

	<td>Based on the hypothesis that the origin of nystagmus is from the posterior canal (PC), the nystagmus in the head hanging and sitting position should be mirror images. To clarify the anatomical origin of positioning nystagmus in BPPV patients, we analyzed the positioning nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) patients three-dimensionally. Twenty-six patients with BPPV participated in this study. The positioning nystagmus was recorded in complete darkness from the patient's left eye by means of an infrared CCD camera. We performed three-dimensional analysis of nystagmus using video image analysis system (VIAS). Subsequently, the rotation axis of the 3D eye movements of the positioning nystagmus was calculated. Among the 26 patients tested, 20 patients demonstrated the axes of nystagmus in good or relatively good alignment to the PC axis. However, in 11 of these 20 patients there was poor alignment of the axis of nystagmus in the sitting position to the PC axis. In addition, six patients showed axes of nystagmus with poor alignment to the PC in the head hanging position. Among them, two patients exhibited axes of nystagmus in good alignment with the anterior canal, in spite of diagnosis of these patients as PC BPPV by experienced examiner based on the positioning nystagmus test. These results demonstrated that only one-third of patients who were diagnosed as BPPV, could be diagnosed as true BPPV which originates from a PC pathology. Besides the possibility that the pathology may originate from the AC, it is still unclear which part of the inner ear may be the candidate site of origin of the pathology of BPPV in the other 15 patients.</td>

	<td>Triple semicircular canal occlusion will eliminate rotatory stimulation to the vestibular peripheral system (as it blocks endolymphatic fluid movement) and therefore release rotatory vertigo attack. This surgery is safe in ears with endolymphatic hydrops. Semicircular canal occlusion has been used as an alternative treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with varied success. Triple semicircular canal occlusion in animal models blocks the responses of the semicircular canals to rotation and spares cochleae and the otolithic apparatus. This result suggests that triple semicircular canal occlusion is a prospective method in vertigo management for patients with Ménière's disease. However, the effectiveness and safety of triple semicircular canal occlusion has not been fully evaluated in ears with endolymphatic hydrops. Endolymphatic hydrops was established in 20 guinea pigs by endolymphatic sac obliteration. Triple semicircular canal occlusion was performed in 12 of them 120 days after endolymphatic hydrops surgery, whereas 8 others were killed for morphologic observation to confirm endolymphatic hydrops. Auditory and vestibular functions were monitored from the time before endolymphatic hydrops until 1 month after triple semicircular canal occlusion. Endolymphatic hydrops and canal occlusion were confirmed by morphologic observation. Successful establishment of endolymphatic hydrops was indicated by mild elevation of the auditory brainstem response threshold and tentative asymmetry in nystagmus. Endolymphatic hydrops was confirmed by cochlear morphology in all eight animals that were killed 120 days after endolymphatic hydrops surgery. After triple semicircular canal occlusion, all 12 animals showed spontaneous nystagmus with a slow component toward the side that had been operated on, head tilt, rotated walking, and tentative asymmetry in rotatory nystagmus. The static symptoms disappeared within 1 month after triple semicircular canal occlusion. Caloric nystagmus was only slightly reduced after endolymphatic hydrops as compared with the contralateral ears but could not be elicited at all after triple semicircular canal occlusion. No significant elevation in auditory brainstem response threshold was found after triple semicircular canal occlusion. The canal occlusion and endolymphatic hydrops were confirmed in all surgical ears. Triple semicircular canal occlusion is effective for eliminating the response of semicircular canals to rotation and caloric stimulation and is safe in ears with endolymphatic hydrops. Also, the static compensation to the disequilibrium is quick and complete. These results suggest that triple semicircular canal occlusion should be an option for controlling rotatory vertigo in Ménière's disease.</td>

Twenty subjects (9 females, 11 males; mean age 15.4 years; range 11 to 21 years) with no vertigo and ear complaints comprised the control group. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver was used in all the swimmers and controls to diagnose BPPV. Four swimmers (13%) exhibited characteristic findings of BPPV, being unilateral in three, and bilateral in one. Interestingly, no swimmer experienced vertigo during swimming. The characteristics of nystagmus were typical of posterior semicircular canal BPPV in all cases. None of the subjects in the control group exhibited symptoms or findings of BPPV. Patients with BPPV underwent the Epley maneuver for therapy. All were free of vertigo after one month. There was no relationship between swimming and BPPV with respect to the frequency and duration of swimming. Swimming may be one of the etiological factors of BPPV. It appears that rapid head movements during swimming cause otoconia to be dislodged from the macula and enter the semicircular canals.</td>

None of the patients had received a diagnostic positioning test until then. Moreover, in one out of three cases a further unnecessary technical diagnostic procedure was carried out. There was a tendency for the right labyrinth to be more frequently affected, a fact that was statistically independent from age and sex, as well as from overall prognosis, which was characterized by a 15.6% recurrence rate. All patients with manifest positional nystagmus were successfully treated: 87.2% immediately after the repositioning manoeuvre and the rest within 10 days by self-performing Brandt-Daroff exercises. Our retrospective analysis revealed that, given a normal neuro-otological examination, a typical medical history without manifest positioning nystagmus leads safely to the correct diagnosis. The delay between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of BPPV is very often unduly long. A focused medical history may be diagnostic even in the absence of nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre.</td>

A training tape was developed to describe the rating scale and provide practice with patterns of nystagmus in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Eye movements of 34 patients, ages 33 to 82 years, were videotaped using infrared/video ENG during repositioning maneuvers. Six randomly paired audiologists and six experts viewed the videotape recordings and completed the NRS for each pattern. Cohen's kappa coefficients were calculated to determine inter-rater reliability. The kappa values were 0.31 with 41% agreement for audiologists, and 0.48 with 59% agreement for experts. Intra-rater reliability for a subgroup of audiologists was 0.55 with 64% agreement, and for experts was 0.75 with 81% agreement. In summary, even in this experienced population, additional training in viewing nystagmus patterns is needed to improve reliability among clinicians during diagnosis and treatment.</td>

Head movements are detected by vestibular receptors and the elicited VOR is responsible for compensatory 3 dimensional eye movements. Therefore, to study the VOR it is necessary to assess the direction and velocity of 3 dimensional head and eye movements. This can be achieved using the SCC technique. Interaction between a scleral search coil and an alternating magnetic field generates an electrical signal that is proportional to eye position. Ideally, eye rotation axis is aligned with head rotation axis and VOR gain (eye velocity/head velocity) for horizontal and vertical head rotations is almost 1. The VOR gain, however, for torsional head rotations is smaller and about 0.7.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) seems to occur because of otoconia migration into the semicircular canals or their adherence to the cupula. Although the origin of these otoconia lies in the macula of the utricle, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) can be used assess saccular function. The aim of this study is to assess the saccular function in patients diagnosed with BPPV. Nineteen patients diagnosed with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal were included in this study. Their auditory function and their caloric, rotatory chair, and VEMP responses were tested. Ipsilateral and contralateral VEMP thresholds, ipsilateral and contralateral p13 and n23 latencies at 100 dB, inter-peak amplitude and the interaural amplitude difference were determined. We found a lack of VEMP response in 52 % of the ears with BPPV. When adjusted for bilateral absence, VEMP response was absent in 20.3 % of ears. Some patients with idiopathic BPPV show a degree of saccular dysfunction.</td>

	<td>To examine the prevalence and incidence, clinical presentation, societal impact and comorbid conditions of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the general population. Cross-sectional, nationally representative neurotological survey of the general adult population in Germany with a two stage sampling design: screening of 4869 participants from the German National Telephone Health Interview Survey 2003 (response rate 52%) for moderate or severe dizziness or vertigo, followed by validated neurotological interviews (n = 1003; response rate 87%). Diagnostic criteria for BPPV were at least five attacks of vestibular vertigo lasting <1 min without concomitant neurological symptoms and invariably provoked by typical changes in head position. In a concurrent validation study (n = 61) conducted in two specialised dizziness clinics, BPPV was detected by our telephone interview with a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 88% (positive predictive value 88%, negative predictive value 92%). BPPV accounted for 8% of individuals with moderate or severe dizziness/vertigo. The lifetime prevalence of BPPV was 2.4%, the 1 year prevalence was 1.6% and the 1 year incidence was 0.6%. The median duration of an episode was 2 weeks. In 86% of affected individuals, BPPV led to medical consultation, interruption of daily activities or sick leave. In total, only 8% of affected participants received effective treatment. On multivariate analysis, age, migraine, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and stroke were independently associated with BPPV. BPPV is a common vestibular disorder leading to significant morbidity, psychosocial impact and medical costs.</td>

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo due to surgical "traumas" has been described in the medical literature. According to personal experience, these iatrogenic cases represent a rare possibility and may be the consequence of surgical interventions differing according to the anatomical district involved and surgical technique performed. The temporal relationship with the surgical action and clinical features may be involved in some of these cases, even if it is not possible to define any real cause-effect link.

	<td>The diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is easy when typical nystagmus is present. However, diagnostic doubts arise when faced with cases presenting atypical features of the positional paroxysmal nystagmus as well as the clinical course and disease evolution. A morphological evaluation of inner ear structures via high-resolution magnetic resonance (HR-MR) studies has been performed in 2 patients that did not respond to traditional therapeutic manoeuvres. In 1 patient, a filling defect at the level of the middle portion of the right lateral semicircular canal (LSC) has been demonstrated, while in the second one, a geometric-architectural abnormality - a 'fold' in the LSC - has been observed. HR-MR study of the inner ear offers a meaningful contribution to interpreting the physiopathogenesis of atypical cases of BPPV. HR-MR of the inner ear is a safe and useful tool to investigate patients with atypical and intractable BPPV.</td>

In this study, we reviewed the efficacy of the Barbecue repositioning manoeuvre in h-BPPV, and we assessed the possible effect of different factors on the outcome. Barbecue manoeuvre consists in turning the supine patient around his longitudinal axis toward the unaffected side until 360 degrees are accomplished. After every 90 degrees step the patient is maintained in the new position for 30 s. We reviewed 46 patients with h-BPPV, treated by barbecue rotation from 2003 to 2005. After the first Barbecue manoeuvre, the patients were followed-up at intervals of approximately 1 week and the rotation was repeated if h-BPPV persisted (up to three rotations). Factors assessed were age, gender, duration of symptoms before treatment and type of h-BPPV (canalolithiasis vs. cupulolithiasis). Fisher's exact test was used for the analysis. 85% of patients (39/46) were cured after a maximum of 3 rotations. 74% (34/46) were cured after the first manoeuvre and 80% (37/46) after the second one. None of the evaluated factors did significantly affect the efficacy (P > 0.05). The Barbecue manoeuvre is an efficient treatment of h-BPPV demonstrating 85% cure rate after a maximum of three sessions. 74% of the patients are healed after one manoeuvre.

Four weeks after elimination of positional nystagmus, all patients were asymptomatic. Recurrence of BPPV was seen in 19.4% of the cases, with elimination of the positional vertigo and nystagmus by means of the specific maneuver for the involved canal. In BPPV associated with Menière's disease, vertigo and positioning nystagmus were eliminated with one, two or three Epley maneuvers.

Twenty-two individuals (70.97%) presented a unilateral positional nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike test, in 17 individuals had torsional nystagmus component, 5 individuals only had pure positional down beat nystagmus. Nine patients presented bilateral positional nystagmus, 7 individuals had torsional component positional nystagmus, in 2 patients the direction of the torsional component were the same during right and left Dix-Hallpike test, in 4 patients the torsional component were concurrent with positional down beat nystagmus but the direction could not be ascertained clinically, in 2 patients had pure positional down beat nystagmus. Nineteen patients (61.29%) had unilateral lesion, 11 patients had the left ASC BPPV, 8 patients had right ASC BPPV. Eleven patients had with both ASC and PSC BPPV in the ipsilateral. Twenty-one patients (67.74%) were cured, 29 patients (93.55%) were improved, 2 (6.45%) patients were inefficacy. CRP effectively resolved the nystagmus and vertigo in 14 patients (45.16%) when applied only once, The average number of CRP was 1.7 times, there were 5 patients recurrence during the follow-up. ASC BPPV was not a common condition. The torsional nystagmus component of ASC BPPV might be weak during the Dix-Hallpike test. The positional nystagmus of ASC BPPV was triggered bilaterally.

	<td>To identify individuals at risk of developing ongoing dizziness 3 months after an acute peripheral vestibular disorder episode, which is usually functionally compensated or even healed within a few weeks. In a prospective longitudinal study, we assessed fear of bodily sensations and cognitions related to anxiety at the time of hospital admission and 3 months later in 43 patients with an episode of vestibular neuritis (VN) or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). All participants were assessed for mental disorders using a structured clinical interview. Only the interaction between fear of bodily sensations within the first 2 weeks after admission and the type of vestibular disorder predicted the extent of dizzy complaints 3 months later; this accounts for 21% of the variance in a multiple regression analysis. Specifically, the prediction was valid only in patients with VN but not in patients with BPPV. Further analysis demonstrated that the interaction was not due to the peripheral vestibular disorder per se but rather determined by the initial severity of dizziness, which was significantly different in BPPV and VN patients. The present study demonstrates that, for the development of persistent psychogenic dizziness after a peripheral vestibular disorder, the fear of bodily sensations is only relevant in interaction with the initial severity of dizziness experienced during the acute organic episode. To prevent development of persistent psychogenic dizziness, we feel that our results indicate the need to screen patients with vestibular disorders for at-risk status and offer them psychological support to deal with their symptoms.</td>

	<td>Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) can occur as a result of disease, trauma or post-operatively. The dysfunction is characterized by complaints of dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical manoeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation (VR). To assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in the adult, community dwelling population of people with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. The search included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2007, MEDLINE (1950 to 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to 2007). The date of the last search was March 2007. Randomised trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Comparisons sought were: Vestibular rehabilitation versus control (placebo etc.). Vestibular rehabilitation versus other treatment (non-vestibular rehabilitation e.g. pharmacological). Vestibular rehabilitation versus another form of vestibular rehabilitation. Outcome measures that were considered included: frequency and severity of dizziness or visual disturbance; changes in balance impairment, function or quality of life; measure/s of physiological status with known functional correlation. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Thirty-two trials were identified and eleven were excluded because of mixed/unclear vestibular pathology, leaving twenty-one trials in the review. Included studies addressed the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation against control/sham interventions, non-vestibular rehabilitation interventions or other forms of vestibular rehabilitation, by comparing the subjects in each group who had significant resolution of symptoms and/or improved function. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the vestibular rehabilitation over control or no intervention. The exception to this was when movement based vestibular rehabilitation was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term. There were no reported adverse effects. There is moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that vestibular rehabilitation provides a resolution of symptoms in the medium term. However there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise based vestibular rehabilitation. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

In the WOD group, there was no significant difference in the stabilometry parameter between values obtained before and after Epley's maneuver. There were no significant differences found in either parameter between these two groups either before or after applying Epley's maneuver. Epley's maneuver is a treatment for the posterior semicircular canal. Malfunction of the otolith organ remains. It is considered that the cause of dizziness after Epley's maneuver comes from otolith dysfunction.</td>

	<td>Evaluate the frequency and characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) arising from involvement of the anterior semicircular canal (AC) as compared with the posterior canal (PC) and horizontal canal (HC). Prospective review of patients with BPPV. Tertiary referral center. A total of 260 patients who were evaluated for vertigo were identified as experiencing BPPV. Standard vestibular assessment including the use of electrooculography (EOG) or video-oculography (VOG) was completed on all patients. Based on EOG/VOG findings, the BPPV origin was attributed to AC, PC, or HC involvement secondary to canalithiasis versus cupulolithiasis. Treatment was performed with canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs) appropriate for type of canal involvement. For the 260 patients, the positionally induced nystagmus patterns suggested the canal of origin to be AC in 21.2%, PC in 66.9%, and HC in 11.9%. Cupulolithiasis was observed in 27.3% of the AC, 6.3% of the PC, and 41.9% of the HC patients. Head trauma was confirmed in the history preceding the onset of vertigo in 36.4% of the AC, versus 9.2% of the PC and 9.7% of the HC patients (p < 0.001). The number of CRMs completed to treat the BPPV did not differ between canals involved (1.32 for AC, 1.49 for PC, and 1.34 for HC). The direction of subtle vertical-beating nystagmus underlying the torsional component is critical in differentiating AC versus PC origin; EOG/VOG aids in accurate assessment of the vertical component for the diagnosis of canal involvement. AC involvement may be more prevalent than previously appreciated, particularly if the examiner does not appreciate the vertical component of the nystagmus or the diagnosis is made without the assistance of EOG/VOG. Head trauma history is significantly more frequent in AC versus other forms of BPPV, and patients with a history of head trauma should be examined closely for AC involvement. CRM is as successful for treatment of AC BPPV as for other types of BPPV.</td>

The study included 58 patients (39 females, 19 males; mean age 46 years; range 22 to 74 years) who presented during attacks of dizziness. The duration of vertigo complaints ranged from one day to 30 years. Arterial gas measurements were performed at presentation and one month after treatment. The patients were examined in five groups according to the diagnoses: Meniere's disease (n=14), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (n=13), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (n=12), vestibular neuritis (n=4), and craniocervical myofascial syndromes (n=15). At presentation, pH was low (acidosis) in two patients (3.5%), and high (alkalosis) in 15 patients (25.9%). After treatment, all abnormal pH values returned to normal. Twenty-four patients had high or low HCO3- values. High HCO3- values persisted in three patients together with dizziness. Patients with vestibular neuritis had significantly higher PO2 values compared to those with craniocervical myofascial syndrome and vertebrobasilar insufficiency (p<0.05). However, one month after treatment, there were no significant differences between five groups with respect to PO2 levels (p>0.05). Consecutive blood gas measurements did not differ significantly within each diagnosis group (p>0.05). Our results suggest that arterial blood gas abnormalities may be related to vertigo attacks.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common peripheral vestibular disorder encountered in primary care and specialist otolaryngology and neurology clinics. It is associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus, which can be elicited with specific diagnostic positional maneuvers. In recent years, specific therapeutic maneuvers have resulted in its effective treatment. In this paper the current knowledge of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of BPPV as well as the authors' own clinical experience in treating such patients are presented. A retrospective review of the records of 204 patients with BPPV was performed. Epidemiological data and results from the audiological and neuro-otological work-up were recorded. All patients were treated with an appropriate repositioning maneuver, depending on the type of BPPV. Of the 204 patients, 163 had posterior canal involvement, 19 had horizontal canal involvement, and 6 had the anterior canal variant. Another 11 patients had bilateral posterior canal involvement and 5 had disease of two canals. The canalith repositioning procedure was immediately successful in 165 patients and in 23 more patients proved successful after its repetition in a second session, resulting in a total success rate of 92.1%. Most of the patients with BPPV responded very well to treatment. However, differential diagnosis of the type of BPPV was necessary to apply the appropriate canalith repositioning procedure. The canalith repositioning procedure is easy and safe to perform, is noninvasive, can be repeated if needed, and can provide rapid relief of vertigo.</td>

	<td>The peripheral vestibular organ within the bony labyrinth of the inner ear is closely connected to the other parts of the equilibrium system. As a result of its constant active interaction with the other elements, it plays a major role in ensuring that we can maintain our balance. In the event of a disorder, otogenic vertigo can occur. Important evidence of a peripheral-vestibular disturbance is provided by the patient's history of dizziness, and confirmation of the suspected diagnosis is achieved by clinical and other appropriate examinations and tests. Common differential diagnoses include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière's disease, and vestibular neuropathy. These can be readily differentiated by applying a systematic approach, and usually respond to treatment. In recent years, improved diagnostic tools have made it possible to test the functioning of the otolith organs, and this may lead to new therapeutic options in labyrinthine vertigo in the future.</td>

	<td>In benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the horizontal canal (HC-BPPV), nystagmus may be induced by neck flexion in the pitch plane while sitting (head-bending nystagmus). To determine the characteristics and lateralizing value of head-bending nystagmus in HC-BPPV. Using video-oculography, head-bending nystagmus was recorded in 54 patients with HC-BPPV (32 canalolithiasis and 22 cupulolithiasis). Lesion side was determined by comparing intensity of the nystagmus induced by lateral head turning (head-turning nystagmus) in supine. Head-bending nystagmus was observed in 39 patients (72.2%) and lying-down nystagmus in 41 (75.9%). Thirty three patients (61.1%) showed both types of nystagmus while six (11.1%) had only head-bending and another eight (14.8%) showed only lying-down nystagmus. In 45 patients with asymmetrical head-turning nystagmus, the direction of head-bending nystagmus was mostly toward the affected ear in canalolithasis (88.9%) and toward the intact ear in cupulolithasis (80.0%). In 9 (16.7%) patients whose affected ear could not be determined due to symmetrical head-turning nystagmus, the particle repositioning maneuver based on the direction of head-bending or lying-down nystagmus resulted in the resolution of symptom. Two patients showed a transition from canalo- to cupulolithiasis during head-bending posture. In HC-BPPV, neck flexion in the pitch plane while sitting may generate nystagmus by inducing ampullopetal migration of the otolithic debris in the horizontal canal or by ampullofugal deflection of the cupula by the attached otolithic debris. Head-bending nystagmus may be a valuable sign for lateralizing the involved canal in HC-BPPV, especially when patients show symmetrical head-turning nystagmus. Conversion of canalo- into cupulolithiasis by the neck flexion supports the current explanation of the mechanisms of HC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent vestibular disorder. Although it is easily cured with canal repositioning maneuvers for the majority of patients, it can be disabling in rare cases. For these patients, surgical solutions may be proposed. The aim of this article is to review the techniques used, the reported cases in the literature, and to discuss their indication in intractable BPPV. Literature review. All the articles from 1972 to 2005 that discussed a specific surgical therapy in BPPV were reviewed. Many of them reported cases of operated patients and described original techniques. Some others are anatomic studies that discussed the two techniques used: singular neurectomy and posterior semicircular canal occlusion. Singular neurectomy (posterior ampullary nerve transsection) and posterior semicircular canal occlusion are the 2 specific techniques used in intractable BPPV surgery. The numbers of operated cases are 342 and 97, respectively. These small numbers indicate that the procedures are difficult and risk compromising hearing and that a very small population of patients require surgical treatment of BPPV. The operated cases have been decreasing since the early 1990s because of improved management in BPPV. This article summarizes the techniques and their results and proposes a currently recommended practice of surgical therapy in BPPV as well as new insights into intractable BPPVs' physiopathology.</td>

We suggest that vestibular lithiasis has a limited contribution to the mechanism that generates HSN. To determine the canal response to head shaking in BPPV. This was a case-control study including 104 individuals with BPPV. The diagnosis was based on the presence of vertigo and nystagmus during the positional test. Subjects were examined by the horizontal and vertical head-shaking test. Eye movements were recorded on a video camera to analyze the nystagmus. The head was shaken passively in the horizontal and sagittal planes, respectively, for horizontal and vertical HSN at a frequency of 2 Hz. HSN was considered when six consecutive beats of nystagmus with an SPV of at least 2 degrees/s were detected. Main outcome measures were the presence of horizontal and vertical HSN, maximum SPV of HSN, time constant of HSN, and canal paresis. Maximum SPV of vertical HSN was higher in BPPV patients with posterior canal BPPV (n = 10) than in controls (p = 0.04). Moreover, the time constant of vertical HSN was significantly lower for posterior canal BPPV when compared with controls (p < 0.02).</td>

Each patient after analysis and diagnosis using two-dimensional video-nystagmography (2DVNG) was treated with a specific CRP in a specific vertical rotatory chair with control of pulse and blood pressure. The effect of this procedure was determined after 1 week with video-nystagmoscopic (VNS) positional control. A 2DVNG bithermic caloric test, an impulse rotatory test, and a vibratory test were performed. Patients were contacted in May 2006 to measure the long-term effect of the CRP results. In this retrospective study of 16 anterior BPPVs (a BPPV), the sex ratio, the average age, and the symptoms were comparable to those in patients with posterior BPPV (p BPPV). The sedimentation CRP proved to be effective, with all patients cured after 8 days, even though the length of illness before treatment was 11.68 weeks on average. At the time of the study, 13 patients were already cured, 8.07 months on average after the CRP. Three patients relapsed (one in an anterior form, two in a posterior form). ASC BPPV is rare, possibly because the DIX HALLPIKE (DH) test does not sufficiently provoke the condition. The hyperextension with the head in the 45-degree upper position, especially in a rotatory chair, is probably more effective. It seems that the prolonged sedimentation in this position is the key to the treatment.</td>

The presence of migraine, physical activity prior to vertigo, and positional trigger of vertigo were the clinical elements which differentiated both populations of patients with vertigo. There were significant differences in adult posturography between vertigo and control groups. In paediatric population, there were no differences between vertigo and control group in the posturography study. The benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood complex is the most frequent aetiology of paediatric dizziness. The duration and triggers of vertigo in children are quite similar to those found in VPPB adults.

	<td>Epidemiological findings on the distribution, determinants and outcome of vertigo can be used for clinical decision making and can help understand the underlying causes of vestibular diseases. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology of the vestibular symptom vertigo and of four specific vestibular disorders: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, migrainous vertigo, Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis. Based on a neurotologic survey of the general population, 1-year prevalence estimates for vertigo were 4.9%, for migrainous vertigo 0.89% and for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 1.6%. Diagnostic positional manoeuvres and treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, however, are still not being done by most doctors. The female preponderance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and migrainous vertigo may be linked to migraine but is not fully understood. A recently reported prevalence of Menière's disease of 0.51% is much higher than previous estimates. Follow-up studies have shown benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence rates of 50% at 5 years and a persistence of dizziness related to anxiety in almost a third of patients 1 year after vestibular neuritis. The epidemiology of vertigo and vestibular disorders is still an underdeveloped field. Recent studies have underscored the impact of vertigo at the population level, but its determinants and outcome are not well known yet.</td>

During the second position, 99 patients developed torsional upbeating nystagmus, which was in the same direction (orthotropic nystagmus) as during the first position (Hallpike maneuver), whereas 15 patients showed a reversed pattern. In 12 patents, nystagmus was not induced during the second position. All 99 patients with orthotropic nystagmus had resolution of BPPV after the first or second trial of the Epley maneuver. In contrast, 12 of the 15 patients with reversed nystagmus and 8 of the 12 patients without nystagmus failed to resolve. During the second position of the Epley maneuver, an orthotropic pattern of nystagmus predicts a successful repositioning, whereas reversed nystagmus or no nystagmus is suggestive of poor response to repositioning.</td>

	<td>OSVaLD (Observational Study in patients suffering from recurrent peripheral vestibular Vertigo to Assess the effect of betahistine 48 mg/day on quality of Life and Dizziness symptoms) is a 3-month, open-label, multi-national post-marketing surveillance study of betahistine 48 mg/day in the management of patients with vertigo of less than 5 years in duration. The aim of the study is to examine the burden of disease associated with vertigo, as determined by scores on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Changes in DHI, SF-36 and HADS scores between baseline and 3 months are used to assess the therapeutic effects of betahistine. Participants (n = 2037) have been recruited from 13 countries in four continents (North and South America, Asia and Europe), representing a wide range of cultural and linguistic traditions. Approximately two-thirds of the patients are women. Sixty per cent of patients have diagnoses of peripheral vestibular vertigo of unknown pathology or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; 13% have a diagnosis of Ménière's disease. All three of the instruments used characterize this as a population with extensive vertigo-attributable morbidity at baseline. The mean DHI score of the population is 63.7 +/- 15.7 (DHI scale: 0 = no handicap; 100 = major self-perceived handicap), SF-36 scores in all domains are below the population average for the USA and the HADS indicated that > 50% of patients exhibit symptoms of anxiety or depression or both, including 9% who have severe manifestations of either or both conditions. This report describes the design and implementation of OSVaLD and presents baseline demographic and clinical features of the patients. Full results of the study, anticipated in 2007, will provide more details about the manifestations of vertigo in routine practice and the response to betahistine.</td>

	<td>The inner ear can be the target of autoimmune disorders. Recognition of autoimmune inner ear disease is important, as it is one of the very few forms of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) that can be successfully treated by medical therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the detection of antibodies to myelin protein P0 (MPZ) could be a diagnostic test for inner ear disease of autoimmune cause. This multicentric prospective study included 129 patients: patients with progressive sensorineural HL or with Menière's disease, together with their control group corresponding to patients with similar symptoms, but of presumably known origin. Detection of antibodies to myelin P0 protein was performed by using western blots. NORMAL: The prevalence of antibodies to myelin P0 protein in patients with rapidly progressive HL was not statistically different from that of the control group corresponding to genetic HL patients (30 versus 28%). In patients with Menière's disease, the prevalence was lower than that of the control group corresponding to patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (5.4 versus 18.7%). No patient with auto-immune disease had antibodies to myelin P0 protein. The sole presence of antibodies to myelin P0 may not be used as a marker of inner ear disease of autoimmune origin.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder that results in brief periods of vertigo and nystagmus, when the head is tipped relative to gravity. Symptoms are commonly attributed to the pathological presence of heavy calcium carbonate particles within the lumen of the semicircular canal(s)-a condition termed canalithiasis. In the present work, we induced canalithiasis in an animal model (oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau) by introducing heavy glass microbeads into the lumen of the lateral semicircular canal. Bead movement under the action of gravity and canal afferent nerve discharge were recorded in vivo. When the head was oriented nose-down, beads moved toward the nose and the lateral canal afferent discharge rate increased. Afferents that normally encoded angular velocity during oscillatory head rotations responded with tonic increases in the discharge rate during gravity-dependent bead movement. Other afferents, such as the units that rapidly adapt to a step increase in angular head velocity, responded with an initial increase in discharge rate followed by a period of adaptation. Afferent responses occurred in the complete absence of head movement and quantify the pathological inputs to the brain that arise from canalithiasis. The magnitude and time course of the responses reported here are sufficient to explain the symptoms of BPPV.</td>

It is caused by loose otoconia from the utricle which, in certain positions, displaced the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal. BPPV most often is a result of aging. It also can occur after a blow to the head. Less common causes include a prolonged positioning on the back (supine) during some surgical procedures. Additionally one can include in this ethiopathogenesis the positioning required during the maxillary dental implant surgery with bone regeneration related to a forced head positioning and inner ear trauma induced by dental turbine noise working in the maxillary bone. Two cases of patients who suffered BPPV after undergoing maxillary dental implant with bone regeneration procedures are reported. Diagnosis and treatment are also described.</td>

Data were collected prospectively from all patients via a preprinted diary which they maintained for 14 days after the maneuver. Patients underwent office evaluation at 2 weeks after the maneuver. A total of 137 patients were divided equally between the treatment groups. At 48 h post-treatment, 61% (with vibration) and 64% (without vibration) of patients were free of vertigo. At 2 weeks' post-treatment, 74% (with vibration) and 85% (without vibration) were vertigo-free.

	<td>We demonstrate a new method for measuring the time constant of head-movement-contingent oscillopsia (HMCO) produced by vestibular Coriolis stimulation. Subjects briskly rotated their heads around pitch or roll axes whilst seated on a platform rotating at constant velocity. This induced a cross-coupled vestibular Coriolis illusion. Simultaneous with the head movement, a visual display consisting of either a moving field of white dots on a black background or superimposed on a subject-stationary horizon, or a complete virtual room with conventional furnishings appeared. The scene's motion was driven by a simplified computer model of the Coriolis illusion. Subjects either nulled (if visual motion was against the illusory body rotation) or matched (if motion was in the same direction as the illusory motion) the sensation with the exponentially slowing scene motion, by indicating whether its decline was too fast or too slow. The model time constant was approximated using a staircase technique. Time constants comparable to that of the Coriolis vestibular ocular reflex were obtained. Time constants could be significantly reduced by adding subject-stationary visual elements. This technique for measuring oscillopsia might be used to quantify adaptation to artificial gravity environments. In principle more complex models can be used, and applied to other types of oscillopsia such as are experienced by BPPV patients or by astronauts returning to Earth.</td>

	<td>Besides the typical attacks of dizziness, recurrent low-frequency sensory hearing loss--together with mostly low-frequency tinnitus--is also a characteristic sign of Menière's disease. It is therefore often assumed to be a prodromal sign of Menière's disease, even without dizziness. During our longitudinal study, which was started in 1995, we reported that there were 81 patients with recurrent low-frequency hearing loss with no initial vertigo in the first suspense year of 1999. After a further 6 years, we investigated 46 (57%) of these original 81 patients in the second suspense year, 2005, for new components of vertigo, with the questions of development of Menière's disease and further development of the patients' hearing ability and psychic situation in mind. In all, 12 (26%) of the 81 former patients suffered from vertigo, but only 4 (9%) had developed the typical signs of full-blown Menière's disease with the typical labyrinthine vertigo. Of the 12 patients who suffered from vertigo, 6 (13% of the 81 with vertigo) were diagnosed with psychogenic vertigo, 1 (1%) suffered from benign and treatable paroxysmal positional vertigo and 1 (1%) had developed vertigo after acoustic neurinoma surgery. We conclude from our observations that, although almost every patient with Menière's disease suffers from recurrent low-frequency hearing loss, only a few patients with recurrent hearing loss develop Menière's disease. However, many patients with low-frequency sensory hearing loss develop anxiety leading to psychogenic dizziness in fearful expectation of "imminent" Menière's disease. We found that 26% of the patients had persisting bilateral normacusis in the low-frequency ranges, while 34% had unilateral hearing loss that was sufficiently severe to affect their lives and 39%, bilateral hearing loss; however, none of the patients became completely deaf.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common types of peripheral vertigo, characterized by violent whirling vertigo after a positional change. Although the condition is termed "benign," the clinical presentation can be incapacitating for pilots in certain maneuvers. We present a case of an airline transport pilot with the complaint of vertigo for 5 d. The vertigo was aggravated by head movements when looking up or rolling over, lasting for a few seconds. The patient was diagnosed with BPPV, and he was treated with physical therapy with the use of Epley maneuver. The airman applied for his First-Class medical examination after the treatment was successfully completed. The aviation medical examiner (AME) issued the airman medical certificate after contacting and receiving verbal approval from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD). While evaluating aviators who have had BPPV, AMEs should not issue medical certificates for any class until the condition is fully resolved. Although the AME Guide states that certification of pilots with other types of vertigo requires an FAA decision, once the patient is successfully treated and free of symptoms, approval for issuing the medical certificate can be obtained through contacting AMCD and by submitting all information and documentation pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment.</td>

In this paper, we discuss more serious aetiologies in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with a history suggestive of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo. We draw attention to the diagnosis of cerebellar vermis lesions and tumours of the fourth ventricle by presenting two cases of patients with positional nystagmus of so called benign paroxysmal type. We review the literature on positional nystagmus, highlighting key findings on history and physical examination to aid in the correct diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo, and to differentiate it from the rare yet sinister central aetiologies that can present with positional vertigo of the benign positional type. This is with the aim to avoid over-investigating a common presentation without missing a serious diagnosis.</td>

Subjects were sinusoidally rotated with eyes open in complete darkness at frequencies of 0.4 and 0.8 Hz with a maximum angular velocity of 60 degrees s(-1) in earth-vertical axis rotation (EVAR) and OVAR. Twenty-three controls and 24 BPPV patients were investigated. Results showed that VOR gain during OVAR at 0.8 Hz in a 30 degrees nose-up position in BPPV patients was significantly less than the gain during EVAR, whereas the gain was not significantly different between EVAR and OVAR in the controls in each condition. In addition, to examine each type of BPPV, we also investigated whether there were any differences between the patients who suffered from dizziness and those who did not. VOR gain in OVAR of BPPV patients who were suffering from dizziness was significantly less than that of BPPV patients without dizziness. Not only cupulolithiasis or canalolithiasis, but also otolith dysfunction was considered to be the possible origin of BPPV. Because sinusoidal OVAR produced minimal nausea compared to constant velocity OVAR, the stimulation of 0.8 Hz nose-up in sinusoidal OVAR may be used to evaluate otolith function without discomfort for patients.</td>

We treat patients with CRM and followed up them in 48 hours and 7 days, one month, 6 month and one year after initial management. Posterior semicircular canal was involved in 170 patients, remain 34 patients suffered from canalolithiasis of horisontal (31 patients) and anterior (3 patients) semicircular canal. After a single treatment session the symptoms disappeared completely in 139 patients, in 40 patients after twice, 16 patients after 3 times and 9 patients after 4 times maneuver sessions. No effectiveness was found in 5 patients; during follow-up 7 successfully treated patients experienced a recurrence between 1 and 6 months, in two cases after one year; they were retreated and all achieved a positive result. It is concluded that diagnosis of BPPV is simple and save, do not need expensive neuroradiological tests; CRM provides effective and long term control of symptoms in patients with BPPV.</td>

	<td>Georgia experienced strong earthquake, after this event the amount of patients with vestibular symptoms increased. Study evaluates 60 outpatients (51 females, 9 males) aged from 18 to 85 years old who applied at outpatient clinics with vestibular complaints in the initial weeks following the earthquake. BPPV and PPV are the most common causes of vertigo. "Idiopathic" BPPV is the cause of BPPV in 50-70% of cases. Head trauma, vestibular neuritis, Meniere disease, migraine are the most common causes of "secondary" BPPV. (PPV) syndrome characterized by dizziness, subjective disturbance of balance and by perception of illusory body perturbations, usually triggered by perceptual stimulus. PPV frequently associated with anxiety symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive type personality. The study revealed "Idiopathic" BPPV in 49 cases and "secondary" types BPPV in 11 cases. 37 previously documented histories of BPPV patients had features typical for posterior semisercircular canal BPPV and 23 patients experienced subjective disturbance symptoms like BPPV, but there were no abnormal responses in their vestibular testing. It is assumed that earthquake could manifest psychogenic vertigo with panic attacks, anxiety, agoraphobia, PPV and could provoke a transition from organic vertigo to PPV. It is concluded that psychological stress play an important role in occurring "secondary" BPPV, earthquake may trigger exacerbation of "secondary" BPPV and could be provoked factor to developing psychogenic vertigo, mostly PPV.</td>

	<td>Patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (p-BPPV) could have mild excitation in the vestibular system on the affected side. p-BPPV is considered to be caused by small particles dislodged from the utricular macula. While subjective visual horizontal (SVH) mainly reflects utricular function, there is less documentation on SVH in patients with p-BPPV. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether p-BPPV could affect SVH. Twenty-eight patients with unilateral idiopathic p-BPPV were enrolled. For comparison, 17 patients with vestibular neuritis and 45 patients with cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) tumor were also examined. For measurement of SVH, we used a device that has a red bar of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in front of the patient. Subjects were asked to rotate the bar to the position that they felt was horizontal in a completely dark room. Deviation of SVH toward the unaffected side down was seen in 82.1% (23/28) of patients with p-BPPV. Mean+/-SD deviation of SVH from the true horizontal to the unaffected side down was 0.49+/-1.21 degrees. Conversely, deviation of SVH was toward the affected side down in 88.2% of patients with vestibular neuritis and in 75.6% of patients with CPA tumor.</td>

	<td>We evaluated 4 men who had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that occured several hours after intensive mountain biking but without head trauma. The positional maneuvers in the planes of the posterior and horizontal canals elicited BPPV, as well as transitory nystagmus. This was attributed to both the posterior and horizontal semicircular canals (SCCs) on the left side in 1 patient, in these 2 SCCs on the right side in another patient, and to the right posterior SCC in the other 2 patients. The symptoms disappeared after physiotherapeutic maneuvers in 2 patients and spontaneously in the other 2 patients. Cross-country or downhill mountain biking generates frequent vibratory impacts, which are only partially filtered through the suspension fork and the upper parts of the body. Biomechanically, during a moderate jump, before landing, the head is subjected to an acceleration close to negative 1 g, and during impact it is subjected to an upward acceleration of more than 2g. Repeated acceleration-deceleration events during intensive off-road biking might generate displacement and/or dislocation of otoconia from the otolithic organs, inducing the typical symptoms of BPPV. This new cause of posttraumatic BPPV should be considered as an injury of minor severity attributed to the practice of mountain biking.</td>

	<td>To identify patients developing positional vertigo after cochlear implantation. Prospective study on a cohort of patients undergoing cochlear implantation. Academic tertiary referral center. The study included 70 consecutive patients who underwent vestibular evaluation before and after cochlear implantation. Medical record review. Recorded vestibular symptoms after cochlear implantation. Patients with positional vertigo were considered case subjects, whereas those without vestibular symptoms were considered case controls. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) occurred in 8 patients (on the cochlear implant [CI] side in 7 patients, and in the other ear in 1). One patient had BPPV of the lateral semicircular canal on the implanted side, and 7 patients had BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal (on the same CI side in 6 patients, and on the opposite side in 1), which were detected and presented during the last examination. In 5 patients, the onset of symptoms varied from 7 to 130 days after implant activation; in 2 patients, the onset occurred before activation. Three different mechanisms are proposed for the occurrence of BPPV in patients with CI. The first focuses on the fall of bone dust particles into the cochlea during cochleostomy. In the second, the vibration caused by drilling the cochlea would be sufficient to dislodge otoconia into the labyrinth. The third hypothesis suggests dislodging of an otolith because of the electric stimulation. In our patients, conservative approaches have been used with a minimal invasive cochleostomy and without perilymph suction. Thus, the vibratory trauma affecting the cochlea during cochleostomy seems to play a fundamental role in the development of paroxysmal vertigo in patients with implant.</td>

Among the 42 concomitant BPPV, 5 cases were horizontal canal BPPV, 37 cases were posterior canal BPPV, and 1 cases had complicated anterior BPPV during repositioning maneuver. 39 cases of concomitant BPPV were canalithiasis and 3 cases were cupuliothiathitis, of which 75% (27/36) of concomitant BPPV emerged within 1/2 years after the onset of primary inner ear disorders. The therapeutic efficacy of the concomitant BPPV with canalith repositioning was similar to that of the primary type of BPPV. Following some inner ear disorder, BPPV could emerge, such as sudden deafness, vestibular neuritis and Meniere's disease. The most common type of BPPV was canalithiasis of posterior canal, and the cupulolithiasis of horizontal canal was uncommon.

By retrospectively analyzing the results of clinical features and therapy in 12 patients with S-BPPV from January 2003 to September 2006, the results were compared with 24 patients with objective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (O-BPPV) of posterior semicircular canal. S-BPPV patients suffered from attack of transient vertigo with sudden onset triggered by head motion but no concomitant nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike test. The latency and duration of vertigo attack were (4.42 +/- 2.02) s and (8.67 +/- 4.31) s in S-BPPV, (3.2 +/- 1.18) s and (14.75 +/- 4.97) s in O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal. The differences between the two groups were all significant (t = 2.30, P < 0.05 and t = 3.61, P < 0.01). The symptoms disappeared in 11 patients after a single therapy of particular repositioning maneuver and 1 patient after 2 times therapy in S-BPPV. The one-stage success rate was 91.7% in S-BPPV and 79.2% in O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal, but the difference between these two groups was not significant. The number of circulation therapy in first management was (1.75 +/- 1.08) times in S-BPPV and (3.38 +/- 1.06) times in O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal, while the difference was significant (t = 4.32, P < 0.01). There were 2 patients recurred during follow-up in S-BPPV and 7 patients in O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal, but the difference wasn't significant. Longer latency, shorter duration and need less circulation therapy are achieved in S-BPPV compared with O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal, which indicate that the effectiveness of S-BPPV seems to be more favorable than that of O-BPPV of posterior semicircular canal.</td>

The study was performed at the otolaryngology division of a tertiary reference center. Forty-two patients (35 with limited SSc [lSSc] and 7 with diffuse SSc [dSSc]) and 74 controls were studied between January and May 2007. Dix-Hallpike and cephalic rotational tests and CTSIB were performed in SSc patients and age-, sex-, and ethnically frequency-matched controls. Type and frequency of BPPV and CTSIB conditions were assessed. Seven patients (17%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BPPV compared with none of the controls (p < 0.001). It was related to the involvement of the posterior semicircular canal in two lSSc patients and the horizontal semicircular canal in another three patients with lSSc and two with dSSc.

This location appears to be a common cause of central positional vertigo and should be regarded as characteristic for demyelinating rather than vascular pathology. In cases presenting with positional nystagmus and vertigo without other cerebellar deficits one should look explicitly for signal abnormalities in the inner part of the superior cerebellar peduncle. High spatial resolution-MRI seems to be mandatory for lesion detection.</td>

This study was performed to examine the frequency of a new clinical sign, pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus, in a large cohort of patients with Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, comparing its efficacy in the identification of the involved side with that of other diagnostic signs, seated supine positioning nystagmus, and the intensity of the nystagmus evoked by the head yaw test in the supine position. Overall, 293 patients affected by Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (197 geotropic and 96 apogeotropic forms) were examined. Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus was observed in 222 patients (76%). After a very slow, repeated horizontal rotation of the head, in the seated position, this percentage increased to 96% (281 patients). The pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus and the seated supine positioning nystagmus always beat in the same direction and both were in accordance in identifying the affected side with the nystagmus evoked by the head yaw test. The differential diagnosis between spontaneous nystagmus and pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus is easily achieved with the head pitch test in the sitting position: the pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus disappears with the head bent forward 30 degrees (neutral position), it reverses its direction with the head bent 60 degrees forward, it returns visible bringing the head in axis with the body and increases its intensity extending the head about 30 degrees backwards. Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus is an important sign for determining the affected ear in Lateral Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Early identification of the affected side improves efficacy of treatment and compliance of patients.</td>

A BPPV attack after a radiologic examination has not been reported previously. We report the cases of two patients who had BPPV attacks after radiologic imaging. The first patient with headache and tremor was admitted to the radiology department for cranial computed tomography (CT) imaging. During scanning, she was asked to lie in the supine position with no other head movements for approximately 10 minutes. After the cranial CT imaging, she stood up rapidly, and suddenly experienced a vertigo attack and nausea. The second patient was admitted to the radiology department for evaluation of his renal arteries. During the renal magnetic resonance angiography, he was in the supine position for 20 minutes and asked not to move. After the examination, he stood up rapidly with the help of the technician and suddenly experienced a vertigo attack with nausea and vomiting. The results of standard laboratory analyses and their neurologic examinations were within normal limits and Dix-Hallpike tests showed rotatory nystagmus in both cases. An Epley maneuver was performed to the patients. The results of a control Dix-Hallpike tests after 1 Epley maneuver were negative in both patients. Radiologists and clinicians must keep in mind that after radiologic imaging in which the patient is still for some time in the supine position and then helped to stand up rapidly, a BPPV attack may occur.</td>

	<td>Chronic suppurative otitis media is among the most frequent illnesses treated in ENT wards. To establish the diagnosis, otomicroscopy alone usually suffice. Assessing the sense of hearing, often the sense of balance, too, is mandatory. Assessment of hearing will show the extent of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Apart from this, sometimes, when the finding is not obvious, it is necessary to conduct audiological investigation in more detail in order to establish whether the diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media is correct. Existence and extent of conductive hearing loss or confirmation of tympanic membrane perforation by tympanometry can help a great deal. Also, some new results about the site of perforation and the middle ear volume influence on conductive hearing loss may help have a better insight into chronic suppurative otitis media. Assessing the sense of balance may show dysfunctions with not yet necessarily permanent damage: perilymphatic fistula and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Unilateral or bilateral damage may be diagnosed with appropriate tests of vestibuloocular reflex (VOR): spontaneous nystagmus, head impulse test, head shaking test. These bedside tests do not require bulky, expensive equipment for stimulus delivery or special equipment for recording nystagmus. In addition, their significance is their ability to provide enough information without performing caloric testing which is contraindicated in chronic suppurative otitis media.</td>

	<td>This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV. The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.</td>

The use of this new device enables volunteers to conduct a correct PRM on their own. This is a significant improvement from written instructions or in-office training.</td>

	<td>To establish if postural restrictions are useful after repositioning maneuvers in posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Prospective double-blind consecutive case study. This study was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital. Three hundred ninety-one consecutive patients diagnosed of posterior canal BPPV with a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Two hundred seven patients diagnosed during the first year of our study were instructed to follow postural restrictions after repositioning maneuvers, and 184 patients who were diagnosed in the second year of our study did not receive any postural restriction after treatment. All of them were reevaluated 10 days later, and they were followed up until their symptoms resolved. We compared the success rates of each treatment analyzing the number of maneuvers needed until symptoms resolved, recurrence rate, and subjective recovery at the end of treatment between both groups. There were no statistical differences in number of maneuvers needed to resolve symptoms between patients who restricted their movements (80.2% of success with 1 maneuver) and those who did not (72.3%). Recurrence rate was not statistically different among groups (2.3 and 3.1%), and almost all patients declared to feel better after treatment in both groups (97.1 and 98.9%). Efficacy of Epley maneuver is not improved by postural restrictions. Therefore, we do not recommend any postural restrictions to patients with posterior canal BPPV.</td>

One hundred and fifty-seven patients with BPPV were reviewed prospectively. An extensive neurotologic examination was performed. All patients were treated with an appropriate canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM). In 138 patients, the posterior canal (PC) was involved, in 14 patients, the horizontal canal (HC), in 2 patients, the anterior canal (AC), and in 3 patients, both the PC and HC. A history of head trauma was identified in 17 patients. In 1 patient sensorineural hearing loss on the affected side and in another bilateral peripheral vestibular loss was present. A history of migraine was reported in 21 cases. A resolution attributable to the first CRM was achieved in 132 patients. PC involvement was the most frequent type constituting 87.9% of all BPPV cases. HC, AC and mixed canal types were relatively rare constituting 8.9, 1.3 and 1.9% of the cases, respectively. Response to the first CRM was recorded in 84.1%. Association with migraine was recorded in 13.4% of the patients.</td>

Presence of the pathognomonic nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Five patients had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, all with the posterior type. The frequency of its occurrence among patients complaining of dizziness was 6% (95% confidence interval, 1-11%), which was more than double the figure of 3% in our local convalescence/rehabilitation hospitals, though this difference was not statistically significant. Regarding the five identified patients, in two it involved the left ear, in two others the right ear, and in one it was bilateral. All four classical presenting symptoms had low positive predictive values, high negative predictive values, and small likelihood ratios. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in the setting of a convalescence/rehabilitation hospital in Hong Kong seems to be underdiagnosed. Small and insignificant likelihood ratios for the classical presenting symptoms preclude their use in making the diagnosis. However, absence of these symptoms in a clinical setting of low occurrence rate can be regarded as against the diagnosis.</td>

Medical centre. Twenty-six subjects with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the unilateral posterior semicircular canal. Subjects were randomized into experimental or control groups. Thirteen subjects in the experimental group received the canalith repositioning manoeuvre and vestibular stimulated exercise training three times a week for four weeks. Thirteen subjects in the control group received only the canalith repositioning manoeuvre. Static balance tests, tandem walk test, Dynamic Gait Index and subjective rating of the intensity of vertigo were measured at baseline, two-week and four-week assessments. Compared with the control group, subjects in the experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in single leg stance with eyes closed at the two-week assessment (P<0.05). Furthermore, stance on foam surface with eyes closed, single-leg stance with eyes closed, and Dynamic Gait Index at the four-week assessment were also significantly improved (P<0.05). The present study demonstrated that additional exercise training, which emphasizes vestibular stimulation, can improve balance ability and functional gait performance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who had already undergone the canalith repositioning manoeuvre.</td>

BPPV represents the most frequent cause of vertigo of labyrinthine origin. BPPV has been reported following surgical trauma from various surgical interventions, regarding anatomical site and technical execution. A surgical origin is, in many cases, supported by the temporal relation to the surgical intervention as well as by the clinical picture. We considered eight BPPV cases of suspected iatrogenic origin focusing our attention on dental surgery with particular reference to surgical extraction of included teeth through rotating tools. The cases taken into account had no other inner ear disease and BPPV risk indicator. We conclude that dental surgery is a risk factor for BPPV.</td>

	<td>A high degree of psychiatric disorders has repeatedly been described among patients with organic vertigo syndromes and attributed to vestibular dysfunction. Yet almost no investigations exist which differentiate between various organic vertigo syndromes with regard to psychiatric comorbidity. The following prospective, interdisciplinary study was carried out to explore whether patients with different organic vertigo syndromes exhibit different psychological comorbidities. 68 patients with organic vertigo syndromes (benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) n = 20, vestibular neuritis (VN) n = 18, Menière's disease (MD) n = 7, vestibular migraine (VM) n = 23) were compared with 30 healthy volunteers. All patients and control persons underwent structured neurological and neuro-otological testing. A structured diagnostic interview (-I) (SCID-I) and a battery of psychometric tests were used to evaluate comorbid psychiatric disorders. Patients with VM and MD showed significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity (MD = 57%, VM = 65%) especially with anxiety and depressive disorders, than patients with VN (22%) and BPPV (15 %) compared to normal subjects (20 %). These elevated rates of comorbidities resulted in significantly elevated odds-ratios (OR) for the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders in general (for VM OR = 7.5, for MD OR = 5.3) and especially for anxiety disorders (for VM OR = 26.6, for MD OR = 38.7). As a consequence, a structured psychological and psychometric testing and an interdisciplinary therapy should be proceeded in cases with complex and prolonged vertigo courses, especially in patients with VM and MD. Possible reasons of these unexpected results in VM and MD are discussed.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) due to canalithiasis can be treated with particle repositioning manoeuvres, which aim to evacuate trapped particles from the semicircular canals (SCC). The movement of particles within the SCC is affected by gravity as well as by the accelerations of the head during the manoeuvres. Moreover, as experienced by the particles, gravity is indistinguishable from an upward acceleration of the SCC in free space. We used a set of three orthogonal linear accelerometers to measure the net three-dimensional linear acceleration vector acting on the head during the Hallpike manoeuvre and Epley and Semont particle repositioning manoeuvres (which are used to treat posterior canal BPPV). The projection of the net acceleration vector onto the SCC planes showed that both the Epley and Semont manoeuvres approximated to stepwise, 360 degrees , backward rotations in the plane of the targeted posterior canal. Angular velocity measurements however showed that the rotational component during the central stages of these two manoeuvres is opposite in direction. A simple model of head rotations during particle repositioning manoeuvres was created which showed good agreement to the linear acceleration measurements. Analysis of modelled and measured data identified that speed of movement during the Semont manoeuvre should be critical to its clinical success.</td>

	<td>Many patients consult neurologists because of vertigo. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BBPV) is one of the most common types of vertigo. Although the clinical presentation of this common condition is straightforward, the diagnosis and diagnostic maneuvers can be challenging. How useful is the Dix-Hallpike test in establishing the diagnosis of BPPV? How useful is an alternative positional test, such as the side-lying maneuver, in the diagnosis of BPPV? We addressed the question through development of a structured critically appraised topic. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, clinical epidemiologists, medical librarian, and clinical content expert in the field of otolaryngology. Participants started with a clinical scenario and structured questions, devised search strategies, located and compiled the best evidence, performed critical appraisals, synthesized the results, summarized the evidence, provided commentary, and declared bottom-line conclusions. A single study comparing the Dix-Hallpike and side-lying tests was identified. For the Dix-Hallpike test, the estimated sensitivity was 79% [95% confidence interval (CI) 65-94], specificity was 75% (33-100), positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 3.17 (95% CI 0.58-17.50), negative LR was 0.28 (95% CI 0.11-0.69). For the side-lying test, the estimated sensitivity was 90% (95% CI 79-100), specificity was 75% (33-100), positive LR was 3.59 (95% CI 0.65-19.67), negative LR was 0.14 (95% CI 0.04-0.46). The study employed very weak methodology, and therefore the results had limited validity. The Dix-Hallpike test is the standard from which the diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal BPPV is made. Hence evaluations of its diagnostic test properties and utility are challenging. For patients unable to move into the Dix-Hallpike test positions, alternative tests such as the side-lying test can be attempted. These modifications, however, are rarely necessary.</td>

Based on a convenience sample, 17 (44%) patients were assigned to the treatment group, whereas 22 (56%) were assigned to the no-treatment group. The number of subjects lost at the time of follow-up were 5 (29.4%) of the treatment group and 2 (9%) of the no-treatment group. Patients assigned to the treatment group performed the self-CRP daily, whereas those assigned to the no-treatment group performed no exercises. Patients were followed for up to 2 years. The main outcome measures were the rate of recurrence of BPPV and the time for BPPV to recur. Of the 39 subjects, symptoms recurred in 16 (41%) of the total population, 6 (35%) of 17 of the treatment group, and 10 (46%) of 22 of the no-treatment group. There was no difference in the frequency of recurrence (Pearson chi; p = 0.522) or the time to recurrence (survival analysis; log-rank test; p = 0.242).

	<td>The benign paroxystic positional vertigo (BPPV) is defined by brief episodic vertigo attacks and accompanied by a rotary-linear nystagmus, triggered by head position changes and is always produced in that position. The theory that better explains the BPPV is canalithiasis: free-floating particles leave the utricular macula and enter one of the semicircular canals, producing an endolymphatic movement that stimulates the cupula and produces vertigo and nystagmus. The diagnosis is based on a typical clinical history, normal ear and neurological examination and provocation maneuvers, such as the Dix-Hallpike test, reproduce the vertigo attacks. The treatments are the liberatory maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver which makes the vertigo disappear. We present two cases of vertigo with a compatible clinic history of BPPV, where the Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirmed the diagnosis. The treatment in both cases was the Epley maneuver.</td>

But there has not been a report regarding SVV during eccentric rotation in patients with BPPV. We therefore measured SVV during eccentric rotation and investigated the function of utricles in patients with BPPV. Retrospective study. Tertiary referral center. Twenty-three patients with BPPV. Diagnostic procedure. SVV was measured in 23 patients with BPPV and 20 normal subjects. We compared the SVV values before and during eccentric rotation toward the right and left in both patients with BPPV and the control group. Between BPPV patients and the control group, no difference in the SVV value was observed in pre-eccentric rotation, but significant differences of SVV values were found during eccentric rotation.

We found different abnormal VEMP rates among the three diseases, as well as differences in the proportion of parameters that were abnormal, according to the type of disease. Vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and Meniere's disease, common diseases that cause peripheral vertigo, often affect the saccule or inferior vestibular nerve, which are pathways of vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). Also, aging could have a primary effect on diminished VEMP responses. Our study investigated VEMP the findings in patients with the diseases in relation to their age. A total of 134 patients with vestibular neuritis, 62 with BPPV, and 29 with Meniere's disease were enrolled in this study. The VEMP findings in patients within the three disease groups were interpreted using our own normative ranges according to age. Abnormal VEMP rates in the vestibular neuritis, BPPV, and Meniere's disease groups were 36.6%, 25.8%, and 69%, respectively. The proportion of prolonged p13 latency in BPPV patients with abnormal VEMP responses was relatively high compared with the other two diseases. VEMP asymmetry in the patients with Meniere's disease was relatively high.</td>

We performed prospective assessment from January 2005 to September 2006. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential was measured in 53 patients with BPPV and 84 healthy subjects, with the latter subdivided by patient age. The subgroup of healthy subjects older than 60 years showed significantly more prolonged p13 and n23 latencies and lower amplitude than the other 2 subgroups. Of the 53 patients with BPPV, 13 (24.5%) showed abnormal VEMP responses on the affected side when compared with their age-related control subgroup. There was no correlation between VEMP findings and the affected semicircular canal. Patients with BPPV may show abnormal VEMP findings, irrespective of the involved semicircular canal, and age was associated with VEMP results suggesting degeneration of the maculae of the saccule.</td>

SPEV and TC of positional nystagmus were tri-dimensionally analyzed. The first patient showed an apogeotropic nystagmus. Head rotation to the left in supine position induced a right-beating nystagmus with an initial SPEVof 15.3 degrees/s and a TC of 133 s. The nystagmus then gradually declined with a TC of 31.3 s after reaching a maximum SPEV of 28.8 degrees/s. After the nystagmus disappeared, he showed a geotropic nystagmus. The second patient showed a left-beating nystagmus with an initial SPEV of 2.5 degrees/s and a TC of 141 s when his head was rotated to the right in supine position. The nystagmus then gradually declined with a TC of 8.05 s after reaching a maximum SPEV of 16.7 degrees/s. After the nystagmus disappeared, he showed a geotropic nystagmus.

We performed stabilometry on 21 patients with right BPPV, on 21 patients with left BPPV and on 21 controls. First, the subject stood barefoot in an upright position with both feet together on the platform with eyes closed. Next, tilting of the head about 30 degrees to the left was added. Then, tilting about 30 degrees to the right was performed. In right BPPV patients, the total length of velocity vectors in the right or left direction on right or left head-tilt were significantly smaller than those in an upright position. The enveloped area and total length of velocity vectors in the right or left direction were significantly larger than those in controls. In left BPPV patients, there were no parameters that showed any significant difference. In this study, lesions of right BPPV patients were coincidentally more severe than those in left BPPV patients, and velocity vectors with head-tilts were significantly smaller than in an upright position. Using the total length of the velocity vectors, head-tilting stabilometry has the potential to become a reliable otolith function examination method.</td>

	<td>In elderly people, chronic dizziness is endemic. However, chronic dizziness of unknown origin is difficult to assess. To investigate whether mild unrecognised benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a cause of isolated chronic dizziness in the elderly. The prevalence of extremely weak, horizontal, direction changing apogeotropic positional nystagmus (HAPN) that had not been detected by conventional examination was evaluated in 200 patients with isolated chronic dizziness and in 155 age matched control subjects without dizziness. A high prevalence of weak HAPN was found in patients with isolated chronic dizziness (98/200 (49.0%)) compared with the prevalence in control subjects without dizziness (25/155 (16.1%); p<0.0001). Symptoms improved in some patients by daily positional exercise for BPPV. Because BPPV is the most common cause of dizziness in the elderly, and HAPN is a characteristic of horizontal canal BPPV, our findings suggest that mild persistent BPPV is a possible cause of chronic dizziness of otherwise unknown origin in the elderly.</td>

In the rare cases when such patients seek medical advice, diagnosis requires careful consideration of the patient's symptoms and the clinical characteristics of the nystagmus triggered by the Dix-Hallpike (D-H) examination. In this study, two atypical cases of ASC benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are presented and the relevant literature is reviewed. Regardless of their unique symptoms, both participants in this study were diagnosed with lithiasis of the left ASC. The clinical manifestations of ASC BPPV may differ significantly from typical symptoms seen in the more common posterior semicircular canal BPPV.

	<td>The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in each ear, and to assess the association between the ear affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the head-lying side during sleep onset. Based on a previous study which used objective methods to prove the preference of the elderly for the right head-lying side during sleep, we hypothesised that a predominance of the same head-lying side in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients may affect the pathophysiology of otoconia displacement. We conducted a prospective study of out-patients with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, confirmed by a positive Dix-Hallpike test. One hundred and forty-two patients with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were interviewed about their past medical history, focusing on factors predisposing to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. All patients included in the study were able to define a predominant, favourite head-lying side, right or left, during sleep onset. The Dix-Hallpike test was found to be positive on the right side in 82 patients and positive on the left side in 54; six patients were found to be positive bilaterally. During sleep onset, 97 patients habitually laid their head on the right side and the remaining 45 laid their head on the left. The association between the affected ear and the head-lying side during sleep onset was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Our study found a predominance of right-sided benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, a subjective preference amongst patients for a right head-lying position during sleep onset, and an association between the ear affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the preferred head-lying side during sleep onset. The clinical and therapeutical implications of this observation are discussed.</td>

	<td>Dizziness can be due to multiple causes. However, the aetiology often remains unclear. At the same time, there is a lack of evidence-based treatment options. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of dizziness-related diagnoses, referrals and prescriptions in a general practice database. Data from computerized patient records of 138 general practices participating in the MedViP project were used for cross-sectional analysis of the time period April 2001 until December 2002. The identification of dizzy patients was performed via ICD-10 diagnoses, free text fields and medication issued for dizziness. Frequencies were counted and odds ratios calculated to describe associations between diagnoses and medication. For the period of investigation, 10,971 patients (from a total of 317,042 documented patients) were given at least one diagnosis of dizziness (prevalence 3.4%; mean age 59 years, 67.2% female). In 80.2% of the cases dizziness was coded as a symptom (R42) rather than a discrete disease. Prescriptions for dizziness were rather uncommon. An analysis of ATC codes showed that 6.6% of all affected patients were prescribed a specific drug for dizziness, most frequently betahistine. Antiemetics were prescribed in 7.1%, and the homeopathic preparation "Vertigoheel" in 2.8% of the dizzy patients. Betahistine was significantly more often prescribed for "unspecified" dizziness, vestibular neuritis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; but not for Meniere's disease. It was given less often in "other peripheral" and in central vertigo as well as in cases where the symptom was coded (R42). 3.9% of the dizzy patients had been referred to the neurologist (55.4%), ENT-specialist (30.5%) or to both specialists (14.1%). The manner of coding and prescribing reflects both a symptom-orientated classification used by general practitioners and the limitation of treatment options.</td>

Patients were randomly assigned to either an exercise or a medication group. In the medication group, betahistine was prescribed at 24 mg/d for 1 month. The exercise group was required to perform Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises six times/day for 4 weeks. The Vertigo, Dizziness, Imbalance Questionnaire (VDI), which consists of two subscales, the VDI symptom subscale (VDI-ss) and the VDI health-related quality of life (VDI-HRQoL) subscale, and the Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) were used for assessment at the beginning of the study and after 2 months. The mean scores of the two components of the VDI and the VSS decreased in the exercise group by the fourth week. In the medication group, VSI mean scores, VDIss mean scores, and VSS mean scores decreased in the second week and VDI-HRQoL mean scores decreased in the fourth week. However, there were no significant differences between baseline and week 8. There were significant differences between groups regarding the change in the mean scores of the VDI (p = .001) and the VSS (p = .001) at the end of the study in favour of the exercise group. Exercise was found to be a better treatment choice than medication and may be preferable for patients with persistent or chronic vertigo.</td>

Those diagnosed with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo received particle repositioning therapy at the same clinic and did not subsequently need ENT assessment. By the end of the audit period, waiting times were reduced to three weeks, and more than one-quarter of vertiginous patients (i.e. those diagnosed with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo) did not need to be reviewed at an ENT clinic.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common vestibular disorder and it has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. The disease is probably caused by the accumulation of lithiasis material from the otolithic membrane of the utricle. Patients experience multiple short vertigo crises lasting seconds when they go to bed or turn over. There are several clinical variants affecting posterior, horizontal or anterior canals and in some cases vestibular lithiasis can occur in two canals simultaneously. Diagnosis is by video-oculographic recording of positional nystagmus during positional tests to identify the canal affected. There are specific treatment manoeuvres for each clinical variant, which a high degree of short-term effectiveness.</td>

We report a descriptive, retrospective and non-randomized study performed at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (Santiago de Compostela University Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The study included 125 patients under 16 years of age who consulted due to alterations in their balance over a period of twelve years (1996 to 2007); they are distributed into three groups based on age: 0 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 years. Childhood benign paroxysmal vertigo (64 %) is the most frequent syndrome in our series, with 32.5 % of patients associating common migraine. Together with diagnoses of infantile positional vertigo and psychogenic vertigo, was more frequently found in the 11 to 15 year-old age group (P< .05). Age, gender and the results of the imaging studies (computerized tomography of the brain and magnetic resonance of the head) were not related to the presentation of associated migraine nor to the diagnosis (P>.05). Clinical history and the neuro-otological examination are the key elements of the diagnosis of infantile vestibular pathology; it is also important to standardize and group patients by age. Imaging studies only contribute high diagnostic performance in children presenting neurological symptoms, persistent headache or who have sustained head trauma.</td>

	<td>The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal related to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear and represents the non-sensory components of the endolymph-filled, closed, membranous labyrinth. The association of congenital sensorineural hearing loss with a large or enlarged vestibular aqueduct is well known as the large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS). The enlarged VA (EVA) comprises abnormalities not only in the structure of the inner ear, but also in the physiology of the auditory and vestibular systems. The clinical picture of this clinical entity is variable [Yetiser S, Kertment M, Ozkaptan Y. Vestibular disturbance in patients with Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome (LVAS). Acta Otolaryngol (StochK) 1999;119: 641-646]. Signs and symptoms of the auditory impairment are more commonly described in the literature: hearing loss ranges from mild to profound, arising from fluctuating to stepwise progressive or sudden. Vestibular disturbances, ranging from mild imbalance to episodic vertigo, are rarely described in the literature. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a labyrinthine disorder with a typical behavior: intense crises of rotational vertigo induced by postural changes of the head, with short duration and usually good responsiveness to rehabilitative maneuvers. These maneuvers are effective in about 80% of patients with BPPV. BPPV often recurs. About 1/3 of patients have a recurrence in the first year after treatment, and by five years, about half of all patients have a recurrence. Vestibular aqueduct has been demonstrated by conventional tomography and computed tomography (CT), however, CT scans cannot show the membranous labyrinth itself. On MR images it is not the vestibular aqueduct that is visualized but its contents, the endolymphatic duct and sac, and can show the abnormalities of the fluid spaces related to the membranous labyrinth. It is proposed that recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is related with volumetric abnormalities of vestibular aqueduct. This verifiable hypothesis tries to define this rapport and explore new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.</td>

	<td>There are many different vertigo classifications and different denominations are frequently used for the same clinical processes. The Otoneurology Committee of the Spanish Society for Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Pathology proposes an eminently practical classification of peripheral vertigo to facilitate a common terminology that can be easily used by the general ENT practitioners. The methodology used has been by consensus within our Society and especially among the most outstanding work groups in the area of otoneurology in Spain. Initially vertigo is divided into single-episode vertigo and recurring attacks of vertigo, and these are then sub-divided into 2 groups, depending on whether or not hearing loss is present. Acute vertigo without hearing loss corresponds to vestibular neuritis and if it is associated with hearing loss, it is due to labyrinthitis of different aetiologies and cochleo-vestibular neuritis. Recurrent vertigos without hearing loss are classified as induced, either by posture (BPPV) or pressure (perilymphatic fistula), or as spontaneous, including migraine-associated vertigo, metabolic vertigo, childhood paroxysmal vertigo and vertigo of vascular causes (AITs, vertebral-basilar failure). Finally, recurrent vertigo with hearing loss includes Ménière's disease and others such as vertigo-migraine (with hearing loss), autoimmune pathology of the inner ear, syphilitic infection, and perilymphatic fistula (with hearing loss).</td>

	<td>The semicircular canals (SCCs; located in the inner ear) are the primary sensors for angular motion. Angular head movements induce a fluid flow in the SCCs. This flow is detected by afferent hair cells inside the SCCs. Canalithiasis is a condition where small particles disturb this flow, which leads to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (top-shelf vertigo). The present work investigates the interaction between the fluid flow and the particles on the basis of an idealized analytical model. Numerical solutions of the full model and a thorough analytical study of the linearized model reveal the principal mechanisms of canalithiasis. We propose a set of dimensionless numbers to characterize canalithiasis and derive explicit expressions connecting these dimensionless numbers directly to the typical clinical symptoms.</td>

The vestibular autorotation test is a method of examining the VOR (especially the VOR that develops at higher frequencies like those that occur in the everyday environment). Twenty patients who had been diagnosed as having posterior semicircular canal BPPV were evaluated with head autorotation tests before and after the treatment maneuver. The head autorotation tests were performed just before the use of the Epley maneuver and after the resolution of symptoms and the typical nystagmus pattern. The mean gain values for horizontal rotation tests during the pre-treatment period were 0.823, 0.844, and 0.840 for the frequencies 1, 2, and 3 Hz, respectively. The mean gain values increased by 0.095 (95% confidence interval) with Epley's maneuver. But this difference difference between the pre-treatment and post-treatment values was not statistically significant. All patients were also evaluated with vertical active tests. The differences between the pre-treatment and post-treatment values were not statistically significant in the vertical autorotation group. The phase values were within normal range in the horizontal and vertical rotation tests and remained so after the Epley maneuver. The stimulation of the VOR caused by BPPV did not affect gain and phase values to a statistically significant degree, and the values noted after the resolution of the patient's symptoms improved slightly but without statistical significance.</td>

	<td>The osteotome method is an often-used technique of great utility in certain patients with maxillary bone atrophy. However, it has been associated with the provocation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which has been described as a consequence of working the implant bed with osteotomes. During the placement of maxillary dental implants using the osteotome technique, the trauma induced by percussion with the surgical hammer, along with hyperextension of the neck during the operation, can displace otoliths and induce BPPV. Four cases of BPPV occurring after the preparation of maxillary implant beds are presented. Treatment consists fundamentally of maneuvers to move the calcium carbonate crystals from their anomalous location in the semicircular canal to their correct place in the utricle.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vestibular vertigo, but it is not well known in routine clinical practice. To determine the awareness of BPPV outside the ENT clinic. Retrospective study of sixty-nine patients treated for BPPV between June 2005 and December 2006 at the specialist clinic. We analyzed the routes and details for their referral and the time elapsed since the start of the symptoms. 42 patients (61 %) were referred through the conventional route (primary health-care or non-hospital ENT); 17 patients (25 %) came from the emergency room (one third of them were admitted); the remainder were patients hospitalized for some other problem (5 %) or informal consultations (9 %). Only one patient had been referred with a specific diagnosis of BPPV. The onset of vertigo symptoms before treatment was, on average, 20 weeks (SD, 32 weeks) and was significantly longer among patients coming from primary care (28 weeks) as compared with the other groups (P < .01, Kruskall-Wallis test). The mean time to referral was shorter among patients with idiopathic BPPV or with BPPV secondary to recurrent vestibulopathy whereas it was more prolonged among patients with a concomitant pathology capable of justifying the presence of positional symptoms, such as vestibular neuritis or post-traumatic BPPV (P < .01, Kruskall-Wallis test). The medical cost of treating BPPV prior to referral has been calculated at euro364 per individual (mostly for non-specific medical treatments) instead of the euro136 needed for effective positional treatment. BPPV continues to be a poorly understood pathology outside specialist neuro-otologic clinics, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment, as well as the unnecessary consumption of resources.</td>

Results showed that (1) anxiety and depression occur with greater frequency in dizzy patients than in the normal population; (2) the magnitude of anxiety, depression, somatization, and autonomic symptoms does not differ significantly in subgroups of patients; (3) women tended to report greater handicap and somatic/autonomic symptoms; and (4) Dizziness Handicap Inventory total scores were correlated with patients' complaints of somatic/autonomic symptoms, anxiety, depression, and coping strategies.

	<td>Dizziness and vertigo are very common patient complaints encountered by clinicians in both primary as well as specialty care in otolaryngology and neurology. Vestibular impairment is an underlying cause in as many as 45% of people complaining of dizziness. Most causes of vestibular impairment can be effectively treated; however, the diagnosis is frequently missed. The aim of this study was to examine clinical assessments used by providers in evaluating dizzy patients in outpatient clinics and the emergency department. Computerized medical records of all patients receiving an ICD-9 diagnosis code for dizziness, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, and vestibular hypofunction over a six-month period at the Atlanta VA Medical Center were reviewed. 476 patients were identified and of these, 157 patients were included. Over two-thirds of providers (69%) used the patient's description of the dizziness for identifying the cause; however, significant variability was evident across disciplines, ranging from 84% of audiologists asking for a description of the dizziness to only 33% of geriatricians asking. 89% of providers did not evaluate a patient for BPPV by examining for positional nystagmus. Primary care clinicians referred 22% of dizzy patients to a specialist (neurotologist), geriatricians referred 17%, and emergency physicians referred only 16%. Dizzy patients were not routinely screened for vestibular impairment based on available recommended practices, likely contributing to underdiagnosis and treatment. Results indicate a need for effective dissemination of guidelines to improve health care quality, increase awareness of medical risks, and enhance patient access to appropriate treatment.</td>

	<td>Surgery of the semicircular canals is seeing a revival as recently we have witnessed the development of specialized surgeries for each canal. The aim of this work is through a review of the literature to describe these different surgeries while stressing on certain surgical aspects, their respective indications, results and their risks. 1: The surgery of the posterior canal relates to the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo resistant to the medical treatments. The results are very good but the indications have become rarer since the introduction of the repositioning maneuvers. 2: The surgery of the lateral canal is the most frequent and the oldest because of chronic otitis and especially cholesteatomas. It is now well codified and is subject to various factors. Plugging of the lateral canal in Menière's disease has just been described and interesting results on vertiginous crises have been reported. Its interest and its place in the treatment of this disease are still to determine. It can be an alternative to surgical management but also to the gentamycin injection. 3: The dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal must be systematically sought after when confronted with a Menière-like disease, a suspicion of perilymphatic fistula or a conductive deafness evoking an otosclerosis with preserved stapedial reflexes. Very often these dehiscences of the superior canal are asymptomatic. High density scans of the petrous bones provide the diagnosis but it is necessary to obtain a 3D view to ascertain the dehiscence. A radiological classification of the dehiscence in 3 types has been proposed. It appears to be of help during surgery. Videonystagmography with and without vibrator and vestibular myogenic evoked potentials allow the determination of the side responsible for the symptoms in case of bilateral dehiscence. The surgery usually through a middle fossa approach will be proposed only to the symptomatic and incapacitated patients. The results are promising. 4: Finally the authors discuss the cochlear risk of this surgery and the types of material used to occlude or cover the canal. The otologists must generally know these indications as this type of surgery entails very good results with a relatively moderate risk on hearing.</td>

We postulate that this complication may not be a direct consequence of the surgical procedure but rather may be consecutive to the reactivation of the biological phenomenon that caused the BPPV. We also observed in one patient that BPPV may exist although no nystagmus can be elicited by provocative manoeuvres. To report our experience of the surgery, and to analyse the rate and causes of complications. The eight patients operated in the department between August 1997 and April 2006 were evaluated in June 2006. One had been operated because he had a typical history of BPPV, but no nystagmus could be elicited by the Hallpike's manoeuvre. All patients were free of vertigo and considered their quality of life improved. The Hallpike's manoeuvre was negative in all cases. A SNHL occurred in two patients, immediately after surgery in one and several months later in the second. The patient with a negative Hallpike's manoeuvre before surgery went back to work 3 weeks after surgery.</td>

	<td>The most frequent vestibular disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In almost all patients it occurs spontaneously and mainly through involvement of the posterior semicircular canal. Treatment consists in vestibular habituation training and in canalith repositioning manoeuvres. A retrospective review of patient files between 1999 to 2001 evaluated those diagnosed as having BPPV due to the posterior semicircular canal in order to compare the response to treatment with vestibular habituation training and with Epley's manoeuvre. The cases are described and analyzed and their response to treatment is compared using Fisher's exact test. The percentage of success with Epleys manoeuvre was 100 %. Eighty-two per cent of patients responded in the first seven days after the first manoeuvre. Relapses occurred in 17.6 %. With vestibular habituation training, a success rate of 90 % was obtained in the first month, and this decreased to 80 % by the end of the second and third months. Significant differences between the two therapeutic modalities were only visible at the conclusion of the first seven days of treatment (P=.01). The evident advantage with Epley's manoeuvre is that it greatly reduces the time required to obtain a satisfactory result. In addition, it allows patients to return quickly to their daily activities and improves their quality of life.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common form of vertigo. Although the repositioning maneuver dramatically improves the vertigo, some patients complain of residual dizziness. We evaluated the incidence and characteristics of persistent dizziness after successful particle repositioning and the clinical factors associated with the residual dizziness. We performed a prospective investigation in 49 consecutive patients with confirmed BPPV. The patients were treated with a repositioning maneuver appropriate for the type of BPPV. Success was defined by the resolution of nystagmus and positional vertigo. All patients were followed up until complete resolution of all dizziness, for a maximum of 3 months. We collected data on the characteristics and duration of any residual dizziness and analyzed the clinical factors associated with the residual dizziness. Of the 49 patients, 11 were men and 38 were women aged 60.4+/-13.0 years (mean +/-SD), and 30 (61%) of them complained of residual dizziness after successful repositioning treatment. There were two types of residual dizziness: continuous lightheadedness and short-lasting unsteadiness occurring during head movement, standing, or walking. The dizziness lasted for 16.4+/-17.6 days (range=2-80 days, median=10 days). A longer duration of BPPV before treatment was significantly associated with residual dizziness (p=0.04). Residual dizziness after successful repositioning was observed in two-thirds of the patients with BPPV and disappeared within 3 months without specific treatment in all cases. The results indicate that early successful repositioning can reduce the incidence of residual dizziness.</td>

BPPV etiology includes head injury, infection, vascular disorders, surgical trauma, and idiopathic events. This report presents a case of protracted BPPV following osteotome sinus floor elevation and simultaneous implant placement. A 49-year-old female suffered intense vertigo and nausea immediately after implant placement using an osteotome sinus floor elevation procedure, especially when changing head position while sitting upright. Despite antivertigo medications, the condition did not improve. Following referral to a neurotologist, BPPV contralateral to the operation site was diagnosed 14 days after the osteotome sinus floor elevation procedure. The Epley's maneuver was then applied and, gradually, symptoms of BPPV disappeared 3 months after the implant surgery. No recurrence of BPPV was observed during further 3-month follow-up. Prevention and management of osteotome sinus floor elevation-related BPPV are reviewed in this report.</td>

Subjects were sinusoidally rotated with eyes open in complete darkness at frequencies of 0.4 and 0.8 Hz with a maximum angular velocity of 60 degrees /s in earth vertical axis rotation (EVAR) and OVAR. Ten patients with BPPV patients were investigated. We performed OVAR tests for all patients for the following different points and compared otolith function: (1) The point at which patients had typical nystagmus; we call this state 'Before', that is, before recovery. (2) The point when their nystagmus disappeared; we call this state 'After' that is, after nystagmus disappear. Results showed that VOR gain during OVAR at 0.8 Hz in a 30 degrees nose-up position in BPPV patients was significantly less than the gain during EVAR at the point Before. On the other hand, gain was not significantly different between EVAR and OVAR at the point After. VOR gain itself at 0.8 Hz nose-up OVAR showed a significant increase at the point After compared to Before. This increase of VOR gain might be caused by the recovery of the otolith function in patients with BPPV.</td>

Retrospective chart review of 148 BPPV patients at a tertiary care referral centre. The canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) was performed until vertigo and nystagmus were resolved. Using multivariate logistic regression, we estimated the relationship between the rate of BPPV recurrence within 1 year and various risk factors for BPPV. Among the 145 patients after successful manoeuvre or spontaneous resolution, BPPV recurred in 31 patients (21%) within 1 year. Patients with recurrent BPPV in the posterior semicircular canal required more CRP sessions and a longer period. The rate of BPPV recurrence in patients with endolymphatic hydrops (75%) was significantly higher than in those without (odds ratio 17; 95% confidence interval 2.9-101). Both the first episode of BPPV and recurrent BPPV affected the same ear associated with endolymphatic hydrops in all patients with this complication. Our data suggest that endolymphatic hydrops is a risk factor for recurrence of BPPV and that prevention of recurrent BPPV is important for control of endolymphatic hydrops.</td>

Physical examination may provide several signs that are likely to enable the examiner to distinguish between central nervous system or peripheral vertigos. Atypical symptoms such as a downbeat nystagmus, a lack of reversal in nystagmus beats when returning to the sitting position and a lack of a latency period in vertigo and nystagmus occurrence during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver suggest a central nervous system etiology. With atypical symptoms noted when questioning the patient or during physical examination, a central nervous system etiology should be mentioned and explored with cerebral MRI.</td>

Over a 17 month period, 432 consecutive patients were included after evaluation at a otoneurology unit receiving all referrals for vestibular pathologies. The existence of trigger factors was investigated, as was the distribution of the diagnoses associated with a positional trigger. The characteristics of the patients with a final diagnosis of BPPV were also studied. Of this population, 217 patients (50.23%) reported a positional change as the trigger for their symptoms, 106 (24.53%) were referred from their initial care centres with a diagnosis of BPPV, and 128 (29.62%) were classified as truly BPPV. The coincidence between the preliminary diagnosis and the definitive one was 52.8%. A history of positional paroxysmal vertigo during seconds was linked to BPPV in 78% of cases. Only in 4.7% of the BPPV cases diagnosed at the otoneurology unit had provoking manoeuvres been performed. We have found that an adequate anamnesis is capable of providing accurate guidance for diagnostic purposes in most cases of BPPV, but the performance of provoking manoeuvres and the correct specific treatment for this pathology is of paramount importance when classifying a patient with suspected BPPV.</td>

	<td>The etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) remains obscure in many cases and women are affected more often than men. A recent prospective study, performed in women >50 years of age suffering from recurrent BPPV, showed associated osteopenia or osteoporosis in a large percentage of these patients. These results suggested the possible relationship between recurrent BPPV and a decreased fixation of calcium in bone in women >50 years. To test this hypothesis, an experimental study was performed in adult female rats. Utricular otoconia of female rats in which osteopenia/osteoporosis was induced by bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) were compared to those of sham-operated adult females rats (SHAM), as control group. FIRST STUDY: The morphology of theutricles of OVX and SHAM rats was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy. In osteopenic/osteoporotic rats, the density of otoconia (i.e. the number of otoconia per unit area) was decreased (p = 0.036)and their size was increased (p = 0.036) compared to the control group. SECOND STUDY: To test the role of calcium turnover in such morphological changes, utricular otoconia of 2 other groups of OVX and SHAM rats, previously injected with calcein subcutaneously, were examined by conventional and epifluorescence microscopy. In epifluorescence microscopy, labeling with calcein showed no significant fluorescence in either group. This finding was interpreted as a lack of external calcium turnover into otoconia of adult female rats. The ultrastructural modifications of otoconia in osteopenic/osteoporotic female adult rats as well as the role of estrogenic receptors in the inner ear are discussed. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms which support the relationship between recurrent BPPV in women and the disturbance of the calcium metabolism of osteopenia/osteoporosis are debated.</td>

	<td>Symptoms such as vertigo and unsteady gait occur in various diseases and are among the relatively common chief complaints. Even at present, the mechanisms underlying these disorders are unclear. We considered the possibility of peripheral vestibular disorders correlating with lifestyle-related illnesses. Under these circumstances, we assessed correlations of lifestyle-related illness as background factors for peripheral vestibular disorders and associated arteriosclerotic changes. Using carotid ultrasonography, we assessed maximum intima-media thickness (max IMT) and maximum common carotid artery IMT and evaluated biochemical examinations in 85 patients with peripheral vertigo. The patients were divided into two groups: those with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and those with peripheral vestibular disorders. The frequency of abnormal IMT was significantly higher in those in the BPPV group. Calculating for average age, max IMT was significantly higher in the BPPV group. The correlation coefficient between age and max IMT was 0.343 (p < .001). All other correlation coefficients also reached statistical significance. Our results indicate that cervical ultrasonography is useful for noninvasive examination of arteriosclerotic changes in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders.

	<td>The underlying cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is free floating endolymph particles (otoconia displaced from the otolithic membrane of the utricle) in the posterior semicircular canal. Particle repositioning techniques are one of the effective method of treatment. The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of Epley's maneuver against expectant treatment and to find out if this treatment should be used more frequently than watchful waiting for the treatment of BPPV. This study was carried out at outpatient clinic, departments of ENT, Combined Military hospital Rawalpindi and PNS Shifa hospital Karachi over a three years period from Jan, 2002 to Jan, 2005. Based upon history and Dix-hallpike testing 44 patients diagnosed as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were collected by convenient sampling from these hospital's outpatient departments and divided by non probability convenience into two groups of 22 each. The control group (group A) was given placebo and the test group (group B) received single treatment by Epley's maneuver in the OPD. The results were analyzed at the end of one and two weeks by history taking and Dix-hallpike testing. Computer software SPSS version 10 was used. At the end of week one 14 (63.63%) patients of group B were symptom free and 2 (9.1%) patients was much better as compared to the control group where only 1 (4.5%) patient reported as symptom free and another 5 (22.7%) reported as much better. At the end of second week out of those treated by Epley's maneuver 16 (72.7%) reported as symptom free and another 2 (9.1%) as much better whereas 4 (18.2%) patients reported no improvement at all. In the control group only 4 (18.2%) patients reported as symptom free, 3 (13.6%) as much better, 6 (27.3%) as better and 9 (40.9%) reported no change in the symptoms. Chi square test was applied and the value of p came out to be 0.001 and 0.002 at week one and week two respectively. It was concluded that Epley's maneuver is a much better form of management for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Isolated congenital malformations of semicircular canals are rare abnormalities. Most inner ear abnormalities occur in syndromes and are associated with hearing loss. Unilateral or bilateral single aplasia of one semicircular canal does not usually result in vertigo, but these become clinically important if there are clinical complaints of vertigo. Computed tomography imaging and high resolution magnetic resonance imaging may reveal inner ear abnormalities. The case is presented here of a 46-year-old male with a 10-year history of recurrent positional vertigo with strong onset when changing position to the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear showed a bilateral posterior semicircular canal aplasia as well as an enlarged vestibule on both sides. Dix-Hallpike positional manoeuvre revealed a positional nystagmus in the left head-hanging position of short duration and latency of a few seconds. When rising, vertigo occurred, but no nystagmus was visible. The fast phase of the nystagmus was mainly vertical down-beating with a slight torsional component to the uppermost ear. Although benign paroxysmal vertigo of the anterior canal was suspected, physical therapy was not effective using a modified liberatory manoeuvre. Brandt-Daroff therapy was effective permanently.</td>

	<td>To evaluate the pathological status of the vestibular system associated with noise-induced inner ear impairment. Totally 68 patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) who presented with vestibular symptoms including vertigo, dizziness, and chronic disequilibrium were screened. All patients underwent a series of conventional vestibular function tests and vestibular autorotation test and the results were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. Sixty-eight (14.5%) patients with NIHL were identified among 469 patients with vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance. A pure tone hearing threshold of patients with vertigo and NIHL at 4000 Hz were between 30 dB HL and 80 dB HL with an average threshold of (46.7 +/- 17.6) dB HL in left ear and (37.3 +/- 16.7) dB HL in right ear. Patients with symmetrical hearing loss at 4000 Hz accounted for 41.7% and those with asymmetrical loss accounted for 58.3%. Vestibular pathologies included benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (45.7%), unilateral decreased caloric responses (20.0%), bilateral decreased caloric responses (26.7%), abnormal vestibulo-spinal reflex function (28.6%), vestibular function response hyperactivity (3.0%), and abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex presentation at high frequencies (97.0%). Loud acoustic stimulation not only damages the cochlea but also causes clear functional impairment to the vestibular end organs. Although the vestibular pathology is not correlated with the severity of the hearing loss, it correlates with the subjective symptoms of the vestibular system.</td>

A prospective study. Tertiary referral dizziness center. Forty-one patients with diagnosis of BPPV and 92 healthy volunteers who underwent VEMP testing. Patients were treated by canalith repositioning maneuvers according to the affected canal, and testing of VEMP was performed at diagnosis and after treatment. Testing of VEMP was performed in BPPV patients and in the control group. The number of times the canalith repositioning maneuver was repeated until the patient's report of relief from vertigo and findings of negative positioning test were recorded to find out the relationship between VEMP results and the progress of disease. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential results of BPPV patients showed prolonged p13 and n23 latencies compared with those of the control group, and we could not find any significant difference in VEMP latencies between patients with posterior and horizontal canal type of BPPV. The number of times that the maneuver was repeated did not correlate with the degree of latency prolongation, but in the "no response" group, the number of times was considerably greater than that in the "response" group. We found that VEMP latencies are increased in BPPV patients, which may signify neuronal degenerative changes in the macula of the saccule. When an extensive neuronal damage was suspected by VEMP results such as "no response" in VEMP, the disease progress showed a chronic and resistive course. Therefore, we propose that VEMP could be a useful method to determine a clinical prognosis of patients with BPPV.</td>

One hundred and three patients with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) were included in the study. The patients were evaluated with the VSS and the VDI twice, at recruitment and 24 hours later. To perform concurrent validity study study, patients were also assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) which were formerly proved to be valid and reliable for use in Turkish population. The internal consistency of the VSS, VDI-symptom scale, and VDI-health-related quality of life scale were good with Cronbach's alpha of 0.91, 0.85, and 0.93 respectively which showed high reliability for the Turkish versions. Test-retest reliability was also good, with a high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two time points; being 0.83 for the VSS, 0.90 for the VDI-symptom scale and 0.89 for the VDI-health related quality of life scale. Regarding concurrent validity, significant expected correlations were detected between the VSS and BDI (r = 0.55 p < 0.001) and the VSS and SF-36 (r = -0.43 p < 0.001). Significant low correlations were detected between the VDI-SS and BDI (r = 0.20 p < 0.05) and the VDI-SS and SF-36 (r = -0.21 p < 0.05). High correlations were observed between the VDI-HRQoL and BDI (r = -0.75 p < 0.001) and the VDI-HRQoL and SF-36 (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) which indicates high concurrent validity. The correlation between VDI-SS subscale scores and VDI-HRQoL subscale scores were 0.028 (P = 0.778) at the first time point. From the perspective of discriminant validity, it means that the VDI-SS measures a construct different from the one underlying the VDI-HRQoL. The adaptation of the VSS and VDI to the Turkish population was successful and both scales were found to be valid and reliable. Thus, they can be used in Turkish people with BPPV for assessment and monitoring the treatments. Besides, the results of the national studies in which these Turkish versions are used can be compared with those of the international studies.</td>

	<td>Down-beating positional nystagmus is typically associated with central nervous system disease. Anterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (AC-BPPV) can mimic down-beating positional nystagmus of central origin, particularly when it is bilateral. Factors that increase the probability of bilateral AC-BPPV include a history of bilateral multicanal BPPV, transient down-beating and torsional nystagmus that follows the plane of the provoked canal, and the absence of co-occurring neurologic signs and symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction. With neurologic clearance for canalith repositioning, exploration for AC-BPPV and canalith repositioning trials may alleviate symptoms even when the nystagmus does not appear to fatigue. In the case presented, the use of a side-lying maneuver with the nose down to provoke AC-BPPV symptoms and the use of a reversed Epley to clear AC-BPPV symptoms are highlighted. This approach is helpful when the diagnosis is unclear and neck hyperextension is to be avoided.</td>

	<td>In vertigo, people experience an illusion of movement of the environment about them, or of themselves with respect to the environment. Vertigo usually originates in the peripheral nervous system (e.g. due to a disorder of the inner ear) but can, rarely, have a CNS origin (e.g. an intracranial tumour or brainstem lesion). It is commonly due to a peripheral disorder known as 'benign paroxysmal positional vertigo' (BPPV).

	<td>Patients with vestibular vertigo syndromes often suffer from anxiety and depression, whereas patients with psychiatric disorders often experience subjective unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the vestibular system may be interlinked with the emotion processing systems. The aim of the current study was to evaluate this hypothesis by correlating vestibular and psychiatric symptoms with the course of the disease over 1 year. This interdisciplinary, prospective, longitudinal study included a total of 68 patients with acute vestibular vertigo syndromes. Four subgroups of patients with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV, n=19), acute vestibular neuritis (VN, n=14), vestibular migraine (VM, n=27), or Menière's disease (MD, n=8) were compared. All patients underwent neurological and neuro-otological examinations and filled out standardized self-report inventories including the Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), the Vertigo Handicap Questionnaire (VHQ) and the Symptom Checklist 90R (GSI, SCL-90R) at five different times (T0-T4) in the course of 1 year. VM patients experienced significantly more "vertigo and related symptoms" (VSS-VER), "somatic anxiety and autonomic arousal" (VSS-AA), and "vertigo induced handicap" (VHQ) than all other patients (P<0.001-P=0.006). Patients with a positive history of psychiatric disorders had significantly more emotional distress (GSI, SCL-90R), regardless of the specific phenomenology of the four diagnostic subgroups. Finally, fluctuations of vestibular excitability correlated positively with the extent of subjectively perceived vertigo. VM patients are significantly more handicapped by vertigo and related symptoms. They show significantly elevated fluctuations of vestibular excitability, which correlate with the (subjective) severity of vertigo symptoms.</td>

	<td>High rates of coexisting vestibular deficits and psychiatric disorders have been reported in patients with vertigo. Hence, a causal linkage between the vestibular system and emotion processing systems has been postulated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of vestibular function and vestibular deficits as well as preexisting psychiatric pathologies on the course of vestibular vertigo syndromes over 1 year. This interdisciplinary prospective longitudinal study included a total of 68 patients with vestibular vertigo syndromes. Four subgroups were compared: benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV, n=19), vestibular neuritis (VN, n=14), vestibular migraine (VM, n=27), and Menière's disease (MD, n=8). All patients underwent neurological and detailed neurootological examinations as well as two standardized interviews and a psychometric examination battery at five different times (T0-T4) over 1 year. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders at baseline (T0) did not differ between the four subgroups. Only patients with VM showed significantly higher rates of psychiatric disorders (p=0.044) in the follow-up over 1 year. Patients with a positive history of psychiatric disorders before the onset of the vestibular disorder had significantly increased rates of psychiatric disorders compared to patients with a negative history of psychiatric disorders (T1: p=0.004, T3: p=0.015, T4: p=0.012). The extent of vestibular deficit or dysfunction did not have any influence on the further course of the vestibular disease with respect to the development of psychiatric disorders. A positive history of psychiatric disorders is a strong predictor for the development of reactive psychiatric disorders following a vestibular vertigo syndrome. Especially patients with vestibular migraine are at risk of developing somatoform dizziness. The degree of vestibular dysfunction does not correlate with the development of psychiatric disorders.</td>

Studies were located using systematic searches in Medline and the Cochrane Library electronic databases, as well as hand searching of key texts, references, and reviews relevant to the field. Key words included third molar, wisdom tooth, complications, unusual, and rare. References from the relevant articles were also double-checked. The review was limited to English- and German-language articles published within the last 18 years. Frequently detected, well-known complications are permanent nerve damage and immediate or late mandibular fractures. Twenty-four other complications were identified in 22 articles. Among these complications were inflammatory processes, abscess formation, and displacement of teeth and instruments. Single case reports describe asphyxial death after postextraction hematoma, life-threatening hemorrhage, brain abscess, epidural abscess, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, subcutaneous and tissue space emphysema, subdural empyema, and herpes zoster syndrome. To achieve good patient care, it is necessary to realize the variety of possible complications. Rare complications must be recognized early so that adequate therapy can be immediately ensured.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is characterized by acute, brief and rotatory vertigo attacks provoked by changes in head position. Most patients complain of a loss of equilibrium and unstable gait during and between the vertigo attacks. Canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRM) relieve attacks and improve postural stability. In this study balance ability of 32 patients with PC BPPV and 12 patients with HC BPPV before and after treatment with CRM was investigated. 50 healthy volunteers served as the control group. Static balance was measured as mean center of gravity sway velocity recorded in four different conditions: on a static platform and on foam with eyes open and closed. Dynamic balance was measured in tandem walk test. PC BPPV patients demonstrated greater sway velocity in stance on foam with eyes closed. After CRM the velocity decreased significantly. The results of the HC BPPV patients were not different from the healthy volunteers all through the four test conditions. Walking speed of the patients both with PC BPPV and HC BPPV was significantly low. It increased after treatment in both groups. In conclusion, patients with PC BPPV had impaired static balance ability due to a clot in the affected canal. Dynamic balance ability measured by walking speed was impaired both in PC and HC BPPV patients. Static and dynamic deficits improved significantly after CRM.</td>

One of the reasons for these differences is that the duration of symptoms was not considered. Because of the high spontaneous resolution rate in HC-BPPV and the medical referral system, the frequency of HC-BPPV might change according to the duration of symptoms. We evaluated the frequency of involved canals in BPPV according to the duration of symptoms. A retrospective review. A retrospective review was conducted involving 589 patients diagnosed with BPPV from January 2001 to December 2006. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the duration of symptoms: Group A included patients who sought evaluation in the clinics within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms (n = 328); Group B was composed of patients who experienced symptoms from 24 hours to 7 days (n = 87) before evaluation; and Group C patients had symptoms for more than 7 days (n = 174) before evaluation. The frequencies of involved canals were assessed and compared between the groups. The correlation between the frequency of involved canals and symptom duration was also analyzed.

For each patient, we also evaluated the rate of BPPV episodes that were recurrent and resistant to treatment and examined distribution by age and gender during the follow-ups. A comparison of type A (1.20 +/- 0.45) and type B (0.64 +/- 0.58) patients showed a significant difference in determining SVV only at the first follow-up (p = .002). Among type A patients, the rate of resistant BPPV was 75%, whereas the rate of recurrent BPPV was 100% at the third follow-up, during which the SAS revealed a significant increase (p = .005) among type A (52 +/- 3.74) versus type B (41.6 +/- 4.7) patients; the male to female ratio was 1:5 (type A) and 4:5 (type B), and the mean ages were, respectively, 56.4 +/- 4.98 and 43.6 +/- 10.2. Otolithic dysfunction explains only brief dizziness. The persistence of dizziness is correlated with mental stress that is affected by the duration and recurrence of BPPV, age, and gender.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of recurrent vertigo and has a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% in the general population. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is caused when calcium carbonate material originating from the macula of the utricle falls into one of the semicircular canals. Due to their density relative to the endolymph, they move in response to gravity and trigger excitation of the ampullary nerve of the affected canal. This, in turn, produces a burst of vertigo associated with nystagmus unique to that canal. Recognition of this condition is important not only because it may avert expensive and often unnecessary testing, but also because treatment is rapid, easy, and effective in >90% of cases. Two well-established methods of treating BPPV are discussed and explained in this article along with a brief discussion of the most commonly used method for treatment of horizontal canal BPPV. Recurrence rates approach 50% in those followed for at least 5 years.</td>

	<td>Postural restrictions after canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRM) for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal (p-BPPV) have no proven value and therefore most physicians regard them as unnecessary. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term efficacy of head and body movement limitations after a single Epley maneuver. A review of the literature was performed to assess the current level of evidence for the efficacy of postural restrictions. Sixty-four patients, median age 59 years (range 37-82 years), with p-BPPV, were allocated either to instructions for movement restrictions or free movements for 48 h after a single Epley maneuver. The minimization method was used for allocation to treatment. This procedure 'minimizes' the differences in the distribution of pre-specified prognostic factors (e.g. sex and age) between the two groups of treatment. Minimization was preferred over randomization which is not as effective in balancing baseline characteristics when the number of participants is small. Outcome was assessed by physician and patient reported measures (Dix-Hallpike test, subjective vertigo intensity in a 10-point scale, patient's assessment of improvement) within 1 week after treatment by an independent investigator. The level of statistical significance was 0.05. More patients with movement restrictions reported a subjective improvement after treatment (p=0.007). Ninety percent of patients with movement restrictions and 74.2% of patients with free movements had a negative follow up Dix-Hallpike test but the difference was not significant (p=0.108). The mean pre-treatment vertigo intensity was reduced from 6.07 and 5.97 to 1.18 and 2.86, respectively but the difference was not significant (p=0.122). Postural restrictions do not increase the efficacy of the canal-repositioning maneuver despite the fact that patients report a subjective improvement after post-procedural instructions. In the review of the literature, all studies except one conclude that postural restrictions are unnecessary. However, a number of methodological issues such as inadequate sample size are not addressed and more conclusive evidence is required. Based on current evidence, the use of postural restrictions after the canal-repositioning maneuver is unjustified.</td>

Ninety-five individuals with symptoms of BPPV and positional nystagmus were included in this study. The diagnosis was based on a history of brief episodes of vertigo and the presence of multiple positional nystagmus as confirmed by video-oculographic examination. Patients were treated by means of different particle repositioning manoeuvres according to the affected canal. Ninety-five patients showed multiple positional nystagmus during the examination corresponding to simultaneous multi-canal BPPV. Fourteen patients (14.7%) had bilateral canal BPPV. Six patients had bilateral posterior canal. Six patients had bilateral horizontal canal, and two patients had bilateral anterior canal. Fifty-three patients (55.8%) had torsional, up-beating nystagmus with down-beating nystagmus, which suggested possible affected both of posterior and anterior canals. Twenty patients (21.1%) had torsional up-beating nystagmus and horizontal direction nystagmus, which suggested possible affected both of posterior and horizontal canals. Five patients had down-beating nystagmus with horizontal nystagmus, which suggested affected both of anterior and horizontal canals. Three patients had torsional up-beating with down-beating and horizontal nystagmus, which suggested possible affected multiple canals. Treatment given to the patients varied according to the canal affected, started with the canal that elicited a strong positional nystagmus and vertigo, and 93.7% (89/95) of patients were symptom free or improved. It has been found that multi-canal BPPV is not a rate observation in clinic, and most of them affected posterior and anterior canals. Treatment of multi-canal BPPV can be effective using repositioning maneuver.</td>

The posterior semicircular canal was affected in all the nine patients. The canalith repositioning procedure was successful and eliminated vertigo and nystagmus in all patients. During the follow-up period (12 months) all patients continued with the usual physical activity; four of the nine patients showed a recurrence of the BPPV symptoms after a new intense period of exercises: all were successfully treated by a new single Epley repositioning procedure.

Seventy-three patients (28 treated nonoperatively, 27 operated on unilaterally, and 18 operated on bilaterally for otosclerosis) with an audiovestibular assessment were included in this retrospective study. Complaints were dizziness in 42 patients (56%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in 37 patients (51%), and rotatory vertigo in 21 patients (29%), with no difference between patients operated on and those treated nonoperatively. In patients treated nonoperatively, despite the absence of correlation for hearing loss between the right and left ears, a strong correlation was observed for the bithermic caloric response (BCR; Y = 2.54 + 0.73X, Y = left, X = right, R2 = 0.71, n = 26, p < 0.0001, analysis of variance). In contrast, the correlation between the ipsilateral and contralateral ears in BCR was weak in patients operated on 1 side (Y = 15.1 + 0.66X, Y = contralateral, X = ipsilateral, n = 27, R2 = 0.20, p < 0.05), and this was associated to a caloric paresis suggesting a surgery-induced deficit. There was no correlation between hearing thresholds and the BCR. The proportion of patients with otosclerosis among those with balance disorders was similar to the estimated prevalence of otosclerosis in the general population. Despite the asymmetric hearing loss, BCR was symmetrical in patients treated nonoperatively. In contrast, the loss of vestibular function symmetry in patients suggested a surgery-induced vestibular trauma.</td>

To see how new ideas in the laboratory evolve into benefits for patients, an attempt to analyze how the corresponding information is distributed was made. To quantify that flow of information, a number of new scientific publications, citation numbers, and a number of new books on relevant subjects were looked at. For vertigo, this approach was facilitated by the fact that the diagnostic procedures for benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) and for canal paresis can be traced back to seminal publications. Results indicate that the current way of disseminating new information used here is working well, and that new ideas on diagnosis and treatment are readily available to practitioners. However, the application of new methods is limited by the availability of the required technology. It is conjectured that the technological requirements have become more complex over time, leading to a slower uptake of new technology.</td>

The aim of the study was to diagnose cupulolithiasis in patients with P-BPPV. We used three-dimensional rotation axis analysis of nystagmus of the vertical-torsional positional nystagmus in 111 patients with P-BPPV and evaluated its time constant. We then examined whether the vertical-torsional positional nystagmus with long time constant disappeared at the neutral head position where the axis of the heavy cupula of the affected PSCC is aligned with gravity. The first parameter showed a wide variation that could be divided into two groups: one lasting more than 40 s in 8 patients and another below 20 s in 103 patients. Since the time constant of the positional nystagmus induced by cupulolithiasis was much longer than that induced by canalolithiasis, this finding suggests that cupulolithiasis in the PSCC induced the vertical-torsional positional nystagmus with a long time constant in the group of eight patients. The vertical-torsional positional nystagmus disappeared in these patients at the neutral head position, where the axis of the cupula of affected PSCC aligned with gravity.</td>

	<td>Volume targeting by bi-level positive pressure ventilation (BPPV) has recently been made available by several manufacturers for home care ventilators. Although it may improve nocturnal ventilation, we hypothesized that increased pressure swings related to volume targeting may have a deleterious effect on sleep structure and patient comfort. Patients in stable clinical condition (n=12) treated by BPPV for obesity-hypoventilation (BMI: 44+/-8 kg/m(2)) for a median of 30 months (range: 2-138), underwent nocturnal polysomnography with transcutaneous capnography on 2 consecutive nights with either BPPV and usual ventilator settings or BPPV with volume targeting, in randomized sequence. Subjective quality of sleep (St. Mary's Hospital Questionnaire) and comfort of ventilation (VAS scales) were also assessed. Mean IPAP, mean tidal volume, and total ventilation increased significantly with volume targeting. Control of nocturnal hypoventilation was slightly improved with volume targeting (nocturnal TcPCO(2): 42+/-9 vs. 45+/-5 mmHg, p=0.04). However, total sleep time and stage 2 sleep were greater without volume targeting, and wake after sleep onset and awakenings >20s increased with volume targeting. Subjectively, patients described a lighter sleep, of lesser quality and more frequent awakenings with volume targeting; ventilation was perceived as less comfortable, with an increased perception of leaks and of "too much air". In stable patients treated by BPPV for obesity-hypoventilation, volume targeting improved control of nocturnal hypoventilation at the expense of a slight decrease in objective and subjective sleep quality, and comfort of ventilation.</td>

Previous medical consultations did not include vestibular system examination, and Meclizine was prescribed to suppress her chief complaint of vertigo. Ultimately, the patient was successfully managed by performing two canalith repositioning maneuvers during a single clinical session. The patient reported 100% resolution of symptoms upon reexamination the following day, and the Hallpike-Dix test was negative. Continued symptom resolution was subjectively reported 10 days postintervention via telephone consultation.

	<td>Th17 cells are a recently described subset of T helper lymphocytes characterized by the production of IL-17 (IL-17A). Since their discovery in 2003, studies on Th17 cells have become increasingly popular among immunologists and they have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune disorders traditionally attributed to Th1 cells. Murine Th17 lymphocytes differentiate from naive CD4+ cells in a specific cytokine environment, which includes TGF-b and IL-6 or IL-21, whereas human Th17 cell development requires TGF-beta, IL-1b, and IL-2 in combination with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23. Th17-related response is additionally enhanced by osteopontin, TNFalpha, and PGE2 and suppressed by IL-25, IL-27, IL-35, and IL-10. Apart from their main cytokine, Th17 cells can also express IL-17F, IL-21,IL-22, TNFalpha, CCL20, and, in humans, IL-26. All of these mediators may contribute to the proinflammatory action of Th17 cells both in the clearance of various pathogens and in autoimmunity. At least some of these functions are exerted through the induction of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8) by IL-17. Accumulating evidence from studies on mice and humans indicates an important role of Th17 cells in mediating autoimmune neuroinflammation. This has led some immunologists to question the previously exhibited importance of Th1 cells in MS pathology. However, more recent data suggest that both these T-cell subsets are capable of inducing and promoting the disease. Further investigation is required to clarify the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of MS since some of the Th17-related molecules appear as attractive targets for future therapeutic strategies.</td>

In this study, we aimed to identify the demographic features, resolution and recurrence rates and impacts on daily activities in BPPV patient between young and senior age groups in Taiwan. This retrospective study recruited 218 patients of BPPV. Medical history, canal involvement, treatment required for complete resolution, symptom free period and recurrence rates were evaluated between the two age groups. Up to 80.7% of patients were successfully treated by a single treatment. For patients aged more than 65 years, the recurrence rate was 1.7 times higher than that in the younger age group (p = 0.07). The symptom-free period before recurrence was nearly 2.2 times longer in the senior age group (p = 0.03). Work-related activities were influenced more by BPPV in the younger age group (p = 0.03). We conclude that BPPV is prone to occur and recur in people of senior age. Clinicians should have the knowledge to diagnose different types of BPPV and treat it accordingly to prevent further complications.</td>

	<td>Understanding three peripheral vestibular disorders--vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and Meniere's disease--is the key to the evaluation and management of vertigo and dizziness presentations in the emergency department. Each of these benign disorders is a common cause of a broad category of dizziness presentation. In addition, each of these disorders has characteristic features that allow for a bedside diagnosis. An effective strategy for "ruling-out" a serious disorder, such as stroke, is "ruling-in" a peripheral vestibular disorder. In this article a focus is on the key features of these disorders.</td>

	<td>To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) occlusion for intractable and incapacitating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and identify lessons that may be learned from our experience. Retrospective review. Tertiary referral centre. Clinical records and results of audiometric and vestibular testing were reviewed on a series of patients who underwent occlusion of the PSCC for intractable BPPV between 1988 and 2006. Postoperative neurotologic examination, audiometry, and vestibular testing were assessed. Thirty-two PSCC occlusion procedures were performed (24 females, 8 males; mean age 46 years). The average follow-up was 63 months. All patients had complete resolution of their PSCC positional vertigo, which has been maintained long term. Thirteen patients (40%) have experienced other forms of dizziness postoperatively (contralateral BPPV in four, continued Meniere disease attacks in three, ipsilateral lateral or superior canal BPPV in two, otolithic symptoms in two, continued oscillopsia in one, and subsequent cerebellar degeneration in one). Postoperative audiometry demonstrated an average reduction in pure-tone threshold of 6.1, 6.3, and 6.9 dB at 0.5 to 3, 4, and 8 kHz, respectively. Five patients had a mild to moderate reduction in caloric activity in the operated ear postoperatively. Two patients with Meniere disease had a significant postoperative caloric reduction. No patient had postoperative facial weakness. PSCC occlusion is a safe and highly effective treatment for intractable BPPV. However, other forms of vertigo may persist or arise subsequently in approximately 40% of cases. Patients with Meniere disease may be susceptible to increased caloric reduction postoperatively.</td>

	<td>We conclude that neck imaging should be carried out for patients with persistent paroxysmal positional vertigo following diagnostic and/or therapeutic maneuvers. It is sometimes complicated to diagnose patients with vertigo that is transiently induced by head and neck positioning. Neck-vestibular diseases also induce vertiginous sensation with head and neck movement and need to be ruled out for the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Two elderly female patients visited our hospital with complaints of transient vertigo induced by Dix-Hallpike positioning, suggesting posterior canal BPPV. We carried out gadolinium-enhanced neck MRI in both these cases. The positional nystagmus was not clearly observed or vertiginous sensation did not show any decay during repeated vestibular examination in either case. These cases were finally diagnosed as spinal cord intradural extramedullary tumor (C3-C4) by means of neck MRI.</td>

	<td>In benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), spontaneous reversal of the initial positioning nystagmus rarely occurs without further position changes. We analyzed the characteristics of spontaneous reversal of the initial head-turning nystagmus in 21 patients with BPPV involving the horizontal semicircular canal. All patients showed initial geotropic nystagmus (first-phase nystagmus) on head turning to either side while supine, which was followed by spontaneous reversal (second-phase nystagmus). The reversal was either unilateral (n = 16) or bilateral (n = 5). The maximal slow phase velocity (SPV) and duration of the first-phase nystagmus were greater and shorter than those of the second-phase nystagmus. The reversal group showed greater maximal SPVs of the initial nystagmus in either ipsi- or contralesional direction than the control group. BPPV resolved after particle repositioning maneuver (PRM) in most patients. However, one patient showed persistent apogeotropic nystagmus after PRM. Short-term adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex seems to be the main mechanism of spontaneous reversal of the initial positioning nystagmus. However, coexistence of canalo- and cupulolithiasis should be considered in the patient showing bilateral spontaneous reversal.</td>

	<td>Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) provides rapid and long-lasting relief of symptoms in most patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. However, some patients express nonspecific symptoms such as anxiety or discomfort after treatment, even after the disappearance of nystagmus and vertigo. The purpose of this study was to assess the residual symptoms after CRP in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) in a questionnaire format. Controlled, prospective study. CRP was performed in 135 patients until nystagmus and vertigo disappeared. Patients were asked to complete the questionnaire before and 5 to 7 days after treatment. A control group of 135 normal volunteers was selected and cross-matched according to the age and sex of the patient group. The data were compared for the pre-CRP, post-CRP, and control groups. There was a significant improvement in the DHI scores when comparing the pre- and post-CRP groups (P=0.000), although six items showed incomplete improvement. Subsequent comparison of DHI scores between the control group and the post-CRP group still showed a difference in some items so that the improvement was incomplete. Even after successful CRPs, Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores indicated that residual subjective symptoms may remain. Thus, additional follow-up and management are important for these patients.</td>

	<td>Migraine and vertigo are common disorders, affecting about 14% and 10%, respectively, of the general population. If migraine and vertigo were unrelated, the expected comorbidity would be 1%, whereas recent epidemiological studies indicate that 3.2% of the population have both migraine and vertigo. The excess comorbidity may be attributed to two factors: 1) vertigo syndromes (including Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and anxiety-related dizziness) that are more common in migraineurs than in controls and 2) vestibular migraine (VM) (vertigo as a symptom of migraine.) VM presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days. Headaches are often absent during acute attacks, but other migrainous features such as photophobia or auras, may be present. Like migraine headaches, VM triggers include stress, sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes. During acute attacks, there may be central spontaneous or positional nystagmus and, less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. In the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing shows mostly minor and nonspecific findings. The pathogenesis of VM is uncertain, but migraine mechanisms may interfere with the vestibular system at the labyrinth, brainstem, and cerebral cortex. Treatment includes vestibular suppressants for acute attacks and migraine prophylaxis for patients with frequent recurrences. However, treatment efficacy has not been validated by properly controlled clinical trials. VM does not fit into the 2004 International Headache Society Classification, in which "basilar-type migraine" must have at least two posterior circulation manifestations; isolated vertigo would not satisfy this criterion.</td>

	<td>Both migraine and vertigo are common in the general population with lifetime prevalences of about 16 % for migraine and 7 % for vertigo. Therefore, a concurrence of the two conditions can be expected in about 1.1 % of the general population by chance alone. However, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that the actual comorbidity is higher, namely 3.2 %. This can be explained by the fact that several dizziness and vertigo syndromes occur more frequently in migraineurs than in controls including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, motion sickness, cerebellar disorders and anxiety syndromes which may present with dizziness. In addition, there is increasing recognition of a syndrome called vestibular migraine (VM), which is vertigo directly caused by migraine. VM affects more than 1 % of the general population, about 10 % of patients in dizziness clinics and at least 9 % of patients in migraine clinics.Clinically, VM presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days. Migrainous accompaniments such as headache, phonophobia, photophobia or auras are common but not mandatory. Cochlear symptoms may be associated but are mostly mild and non-progressive. During acute attacks one may find central spontaneous or positional nystagmus and, less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. In the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing adds little to the diagnosis as findings are mostly minor and non-specific. In the absence of controlled studies, treatment of VM is adopted from the migraine sphere comprising avoidance of triggers, stress management as well as pharmacotherapy for acute attacks and prophylaxis.</td>

	<td>Diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a mixture of empiricism of particle repositioning with the rationally-based knowledge obtained from clinical observations, histopathology, and neurophysiological experiments. The recently published clinical practice guideline on BPPV makes recommendations on the management of BPPV. One of the statements discourages the use of radiographic or vestibular testing, unless the diagnosis was uncertain or there were additional signs or symptoms unrelated to BPPV. The role of video-oculography in diagnosis and treatment of BPPV is argued, since vestibular testing has provided key relevant information to understand positional nystagmus in patients with BPPV.</td>

Using chi square test to compare the ratio of paresis SC between the two groups (t = 0.654, P < 0.05), the differences between the two groups were not statistical. PRM has no influence to the bithermal test in BPPV. The mechanisms of the paresis SC function may be the extensive pathological changes in the vestibular system.

	<td>An extremely rare case with labyrinthine anomaly with normal hearing was demonstrated. This case firstly showed transient positioning vertigo like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and subsequently episodic vertigo like Meniere's disease. A 55-year-old male attended our hospital, complaining of transient but persistent positioning vertigo in 2004. The apogeotropic positioning nystagmus was observed in spine position. In 2005, he came to feel episodic vertigo continuously for more than 30min like Meniere's disease. We examined CT scan and 3D-MRI, indicating the hypoplastic lateral semicircular canal (L-SCC) fused together with enlarged vestibule on the left side. We finally diagnosed this case as Mondini anomaly on the left side. The imaging analysis is the most useful for differential diagnosis of Mondini anomalies, because symptoms in these patients are actually various due to the individual inner ear condition. The mechanism of generation of BPPV-like vertigo: the otolith in deformed utricle might be transferred into the fused space with vestibule and L-SCC, resulting in the irrigation of the hypoplastic cupula. The mechanism of generation of Meniere's disease-like vertigo: neuro-otologic findings with furosemide test implied endolymphatic hydrops on the left side. Meniere's disease-like episodic vertigo could be due to subsequently generated endolymphatic hydrops.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral cause of vertigo. Although its pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear, different locations have been attributed throughout the last century, from the days of Bárány. Disease was initially located by Dix and Hallpike in the utricle, but later, Schuknecht's works elicited the cupulolithiasis and canalolithiasis theories, localizing the pathology to the semicircular canal system and mainly to the posterior one. However, conflicting evidences from temporal bone studies accumulated against this theory, which suggest other explanations. Although this clinical entity is well defined, and can usually be effectively treated with certain physical maneuvers, its pathophysiology is still obscure and is being critically discussed in this article, which reviews the milestones of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo understanding.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in older adults. The effectiveness of the repositioning maneuver as an intervention has been established in the literature; however, the efficacy of the posttreatment instructions has not been established. The purpose of this retrospective study was compare treatment outcomes for patients receiving 24 hour postural restrictions posttreatment versus 48 hour restrictions. Medical records of 76 patients diagnosed with BPPV at an outpatient physical therapy practice were reviewed. The average age was 61.05 years (SD 16.16). A positive outcome was determined by partial or complete resolution of symptoms, defined as a reduction in the number of special tests or positions that provoked symptoms from initial examination to discharge, as well as a reduction in vertigo intensity ratings. Patients in both groups experienced significant reductions in the number of symptom provoking positions, positive special tests, and ratings of vertigo intensity following treatment. Mean ratings of vertigo intensity on a 10 point scale were 5.71 pre and 1.83 post for the 24 hour group, and 6.75 pre and 3.00 post for the 48 hour group. Positive treatment outcomes were experienced by 95.4% of patients in the 24 hour group (n=63), with 53% (n=35) achieving complete resolution. Patients experienced positive treatment outcomes regardless of the length of postural restrictions following repositioning maneuver for BPPV. Therapists can reduce the length of postural restrictions to 24 hours upright following a repositioning maneuver without adversely affecting patient outcomes.</td>

	<td>In the present study, we investigated the body sway in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction by the largest Lyapunov exponents using a chaotic time series analysis. The largest Lyapunov exponent is regarded as a parameter indexing an orbital instability. Subjects consisted of 55 normal healthy subjects, 11 patients diagnosed as having vestibular neuritis (VN), 6 patients diagnosed as having sudden deafness (SD) with vertigo, 23 patients diagnosed as having Meniere disease (MD), 11 patients diagnosed as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and 14 patients diagnosed as having other vestibular disorders. Using a stabilometer, the sway of the body center of gravity in an upright standing position was recorded with eyes open and closed for 60 seconds under each condition. From the time series data obtained, the largest Lyapunov exponents were calculated using a chaos analysis program. In normal healthy subjects and patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction, the largest Lyapunov exponents on right-left sway were larger than those on forward-backward sway with eyes open and closed. The largest Lyapunov exponents in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction on forward-backward sway with eyes closed were significantly larger than those in normal healthy subjects. A few patients with the instability of standing posture judged from conventional analysis (area of sway, locus length per time) showed higher values of the LLE. We investigated the variation of the values of the largest Lyapunov exponents in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction at each stage during recovery from their vestibular damage. The largest Lyapunov exponents at the early stage with stable standing posture were significantly higher than those at the late stable stage with stable standing posture. Some patients at the very early stage had lower values of the largest Lyapunov exponents. We speculate that the orbital instability indicated by the values of the largest Lyapunov exponents has a different significance from instability of standing posture indicated by a conventional analysis. We propose that the largest Lyapunov exponents may be an useful subsidiary measure to evaluate postural stability and its change due to vestibular dysfunction.</td>

This paper aims at studying the audiologic characteristics of elderly with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal. We carried out a retrospective analysis of threshold tonal audiometry exams of 37 senior citizens with posterior semicircular canal BPPV and also of 37 elderly without complaints of dizziness and/or vertigo, and we studied the audiologic characteristics of the two groups. Both groups had high rates of hearing loss, especially the descending curve sensorineural type, and there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Having such data, we can conclude that posterior semicircular canal BPPV has no impact on the hearing loss features of senior citizens; nonetheless, because of the spontaneous degeneration of the vestibulocochlear system, such population has a prevalence of hearing loss.</td>

	<td>It is reported in some individual patients that vestibular stimuli can trigger migraine attacks. This study used a case-control design to examine systematically the hypothesis that vertigo induced by vestibular stimulation (rotation/caloric testing) can act as a specific migraine trigger. A total of 123 new patients attending neuro-otology or neurology clinics were studied with questionnaires and physician interview to ascertain migraine history according to International Headache Society criteria. A total of 79 who underwent rotation/caloric vestibular testing (test group) were compared with 44 control patients in whom no such testing was carried out (control group). The principal outcome measure was the occurrence of a migraine attack within 24 hours of exposure to vestibular stimulation. Of those participants with a past history of migraines, 19/39 (49%) of the test group experienced a migraine in the study time window, compared with 1/21 (5%) of the control group. Binary logistic regression analysis confirmed that vestibular testing was associated (p < 0.05) with migraine attacks. The results indicate that induced vertigo can act as a migraine trigger, a finding with implications for the diagnosis of patients with episodic vertigo and migraine headache. While such patients may well have basilar migraine or migrainous vertigo, alternatively, another disorder causing episodic vertigo (e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or Ménière disease) may be triggering migraine headaches.</td>

	<td>This article summarizes the emergency department approach to diagnosing cerebellar infarction in the patient presenting with vertigo. Vertigo is defined and identification of a vertigo syndrome is discussed. The differentiation of common vertigo syndromes such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, migrainous vertigo, and vestibular neuritis is summarized. Confirmation of a peripheral vertigo syndrome substantially lowers the likelihood of cerebellar infarction, as do indicators of a peripheral disorder such as an abnormal head impulse test. Approximately 10% of patients with cerebellar infarction present with vertigo and no localizing neurologic deficits. The majority of these may have other signs of central vertigo, specifically direction-changing nystagmus and severe ataxia.</td>

	<td>The most common vestibular disorders seen in the emergency department (ED) are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and acute peripheral vestibulopathy (APV; i.e., vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis). BPPV and APV are two very distinct disorders that have different clinical presentations that require different diagnostic and treatment strategies. BPPV can be diagnosed without imaging and is treated with canalith-repositioning maneuvers. APV sometimes requires neuroimaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude posterior fossa stroke mimics and should be treated with vestibular sedatives and corticosteroids. We sought to determine if emergency physicians (EPs) apply best practices to diagnose and treat these common vestibular disorders. This was a cross-sectional study of ED visits from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). A weighted sample of U.S. ED visits (1993-2005) was used. Patients at least 16 years of age who were given a final ED diagnosis of BPPV (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9], 386.11) or APV (ICD-9 386.12 or 386.3x) comprised the study population. The frequency of imaging and drug therapy in those diagnosed as BPPV or APV versus controls was the main outcome measure. A total of 9,472 dizzy patient visits were sampled over 13 years (weighted estimate 33.6 million U.S. ED visits over that period). A weighted estimate of 2.5 million patients (7.4%) were given a vestibular diagnosis, mostly BPPV (weighted 0.2 million) or APV (weighted 1.9 million). Patients given BPPV (19%) and APV (19%) diagnoses were more likely to undergo imaging (all by computed tomography [CT]) than controls (7%; p < 0.001). Patients given BPPV (58%) and APV (70%) diagnoses were more likely to receive meclizine than controls (0.1%; p < 0.001). Corticosteroid administration was rarely documented (2% BPPV, 1% APV). Patients given a vestibular diagnosis in the ED may not be managed optimally. Patients given BPPV and APV diagnoses undergo imaging (predominantly CT) with equal frequency, suggesting overuse of CT (BPPV) and probably underuse of MRI (APV). Most patients diagnosed with BPPV are given meclizine, which is not indicated. Specific therapy for APV (corticosteroids) is probably underutilized. Educational initiatives and clinical guidelines merit consideration.</td>

	<td>The first reports of an involvement of the lateral canal (LC) in paroxysmal positional vertigo (PPV), were published in 1985, by Luciano Cipparrone et al., from Italy and Joseph McClure from Canada. The increasing interest of otolaryngologists and neurologists has led to a progressive advance in the knowledge of this labyrinthine disorder regarding its epidemiological, physiopathological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects. According to the most recent data, LC-benign PPV accounts for 17% of all PPV patients, regardless of gender and between the two labyrinths. The LC-PPV syndrome is characterized by intense positional vertigo and direction-changing geotropic horizontal nystagmus, both caused by rotation of the head in the supine position. Less frequently, it presents with apogeotropic nystagmus. In some patients nystagmus is also detectable in the sitting position, mimicking a spontaneous nystagmus. In most cases nystagmus is caused by displaced otoconia floating in the semicircular canal. The pathological side, which must be identified for successful treatment, is usually indicated by nystagmus intensity: the more intense positional nystagmus beats toward the affected ear. In a few cases, where there is no difference in nystgmus intensity, other indicators are necessary to determine the pathological side. Vestibular neuritis and posterior fossa lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Treatment of LC-PPV relies on some physical maneuvers, the objective of which is to allow the otoconial debris to exit from the LC by centrifugal inertia and/or by gravitation.</td>

Their nystagmus was observed only in a supine or head-hanging position and it was never observed upon returning to a sitting position and never reversed. The nystagmus had no or little torsional component, had latency and tended to decrease with time. The positional DBN (p-DBN) is known to be indicative of a central nervous system disorder. Recently there were some reports that canalithiasis of the anterior semicircular canal (ASC) causes p-DBN and that patients who have p-DBN without obvious CNS dysfunction are dealt with anterior semicircular canal (ASC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). There are some doubts as to the validity of making a diagnosis of ASC-BPPV in a case of p-DBN without CNS findings. It is hard to determine the cause of p-DBN in these cases.</td>

Two rare cases of post-traumatic occurrence of hearing loss, olfactory dysfunction and benign positional vertigo are reported and the pathophysiology of the association between sensorineural hearing loss, anosmia and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, after head injury, are briefly discussed.

A retrospective review of case notes and vestibular assessment reports of 100 consecutive patients referred for vestibular assessment. Sixty of the 100 patients had an abnormal vestibular assessment. Eleven patients had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo as the sole diagnosis, of whom nine had not had a Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre performed before referral. Of patients referred for vestibular rehabilitation, 76 per cent had an abnormal electrophysiological assessment. After vestibular assessment, 35 patients were discharged with no further follow-up appointments in the ENT department. All patients should have a Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre performed prior to referral for vestibular assessment. The majority of our patients undergoing vestibular rehabilitation had abnormal test results, although a significant number did not. Prior to referral, it is worth considering the implication of a 'normal' and 'abnormal' result for the management of the patient. Careful consideration should be given to the development of dedicated dizziness clinics run by practitioners with a specialist interest in balance disorders, in order to ensure appropriate requests for vestibular assessment.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo prompting patients to seek medical treatment. Diagnosis is made by identifying characteristic nystagmus with positional testing (e.g., Dix-Hallpike maneuver) during a clinical examination. Although diagnosis can be accurately made by non-specialists, costly diagnostic tests are frequently obtained. We examined diagnostic tests ordered and use of specialty consultations in the evaluation of patients eventually diagnosed in our clinic with BPPV. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 193 consecutive adult patients referred to our otoneurology clinic and subsequently diagnosed with isolated BPPV of the posterior canal from 2003 to 2008. In all cases, symptoms resolved after treatment. One hundred thirty-six patients (71%) underwent at least one test, and no tests were diagnostic. The test most frequently ordered was brain magnetic resonance imaging (n=76), followed by audiogram (n=64), serologic tests (n=42), brain computed tomographic scan (n=32), caloric electronystagmography (n=24), and magnetic resonance angiography (n=23). Internists and otolaryngologists evaluated the same number of patients (n=75) prior to being seen in our clinic, and neurologists saw the next largest group (n=52). Family and emergency physicians evaluated 22 and 16 patients, respectively. The number of diagnostic tests ordered did not significantly vary from 2003 to 2008. Patients with isolated BPPV undergo many tests of no yield despite the definitive test for diagnosis being a bedside maneuver. Increased use of tests for positional nystagmus likely would improve diagnostic yield and decrease costs in evaluating patients with this common disorder.</td>

	<td>Despite its frequent occurrence and effective treatment options, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) still remains under-estimated in the community. We reviewed referral letters and medical records of 120 patients who were treated for BPPV at our Dizziness Clinic during the years 2006-2008 and searched for factors that possibly contribute to missing this entity. The referral diagnosis could be clustered into four groups: BPPV (25.6%), further unspecified vertigo (36.6%), dizziness (27.5%) and other (10%). BPPV was recognized more frequently by ENT doctors than by other specialists.Patients referred with the correct diagnosis of BPPV were significantly younger and the duration of their symptoms shorter than in other referral groups. Patients in the distinct referral groups did not differ in the presence of autonomic symptoms or a history of another serious disease. A history typical of BPPV could be obtained in all but 11 patients, but position dependence was noted by the referring physician only in 55 patients, 31 of them correctly assigned as possible BPPV. Only in two patients was the Dix-Hallpike test performed. Thirty two patients were diagnosed with BPPV in the past, but this did not influence the recognition of the recurrence of this clinical entity. About 40% of patients had an audiogram and/or brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Electronystagmography was performed in 7.5% and brain imaging in 14% of patients before referral. Our results show that BPPV is still an under-recognized entity.Education and the demand on specialists to learn how to treat BPPV, could improve the situation.</td>

In 86 of them, BPPV was suspected during the first visit, and in the remaining patients, another diagnosis was initially assumed.The mean period between the first visit to final diagnosis was 14.9 months. Seven percent of patients had to be examined repeatedly until signs of BPPV could be elicited. Seventy-nine percent of patients had a laboratory examination before the diagnosis was established. At a specialized clinic, the method of reexamination in patients with recurrent vertigo and a normal neurotologic examination between attacks are useful for clarifying the diagnosis. A high confidence is justified when suspecting the diagnosis of BPPV between the attacks. Auxiliary examinations can be reserved for cases with an atypical history or abnormal findings on neurotologic testing.</td>

Although many causes of vertigo in adulthood occur also in childhood, their frequency may be different. A typical example is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the most common peripheral vestibular disorder in adults, which occurs quite uncommonly in children. Furthermore, many common diseases causing vertigo in children may be unique for this population, such as benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) of childhood. At present, BPV is defined as a migraine's equivalent, a precursor of migraine or a periodic syndrome of childhood. The International Headache Society also studied this form of vertigo and included the Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo in section 1.3.3. of the International Classification of Headaches (ICHD-2).

One hundred and three patients attended for follow up (58 women and 45 men; age range 19-65 years). As mentioned 269 patients were offered the EM and 103 of them were available for follow up. Prior to initial Epley's manoeuvre treatment, these patients' duration of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo had ranged from four to 96 weeks. Five years after treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with Epley's manoeuvre, 65 per cent of patients reported no further attacks. Kaplan-Meier testing showed that the time to recurrence was significantly longer in patients aged less than 40 years, those with a duration of attacks of less than three years prior to initial Epley's manoeuvre treatment, and those suffering less than six exacerbations prior to initial Epley's manoeuvre treatment. Gender had no effect on time to recurrence. Duration of illness before receiving Epley's manoeuvre was the only independent predictor of recurrence. Epley's manoeuvre remains an effective modality for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A patient age of less than 40 years and duration of attacks of less than three years are good prognostic factors. Exacerbation number and gender do not affect the probability of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence after five years; however, these factors do affect the duration of time free from the condition.</td>

	<td>Comparing the effects of different disorders and interventions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important for healthcare policy and accountability. There are two basic approaches to measure HRQoL: questionnaires derived from psychometrics and preference-based measures or utilities derived from econometrics. While disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires, such as the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), are important because they focus on the impact of a specific problem and its treatments (i.e., vestibular disorders), economic comparisons of the impacts of diseases/disorders and their treatments are typically based on utility assessment. The utility measures for audiology application (UMAA) were developed to measure utilities for various audiologic conditions using a standard computer. The purpose of this study was to determine if the UMAA provides stable, valid, and sensitive utility measures of the effects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and its treatment on HRQoL. It was hypothesized that utilities, as measured by the UMAA, would indicate improvement in HRQoL post-treatment for BPPV comparable to a disease-specific health status measure (DHI). The UMAA incorporates three techniques to measure utility: rating scale, standard gamble, and time tradeoff. A utility is a cardinal measure of strength of preference and is measured on a continuum basis from 0.0 (incapacitating dizziness) to 1.0 (no dizziness). Fifty-two adults with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal completed the UMAA and DHI before treatment and again post-treatment. A subgroup of 15 participants completed the UMAA on two occasions before treatment to assess test-retest stability and to establish critical difference values. Results from this investigation demonstrate that utilities as measured through the UMAA are stable, valid, and comparable to the DHI. Post-treatment utilities were also significantly higher than pretreatment utilities, indicating that the utilities, as measured through the UMAA, are sensitive to improvement in HRQoL after BPPV treatment. Utilities as measured through the UMAA seem sensitive to changes in HRQoL after treatment of BPPV. Since the UMAA can be used to measure patient preference (i.e., utility), it may be useful for comparison of specific audiologic conditions, such as BPPV, to nonaudiologic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.</td>

The prevalence of BPPV in our patients with EH was 5.1%. The rate of cure with the repositioning manoeuvres is 90.9%, however success with the first manoeuvre was only 63.36%. Recurrences occurred in up to 22.22%. We found a lower success rate with the first manoeuvre in relation to the rest of the patients with BPPV without EH. This difference is statistically significant (P=0.042). We did not find that these patients to have a lower rate of cure with the repositioning manoeuvres or a higher rate of recurrence. But in our protocol the first manoeuvre had a lower success rate than in the rest of the patients.</td>

	<td>Childhood dizziness may take many forms; most often it presents as acute short-lived spinning attacks associated with headaches and nausea and less frequently as long-lasting symptoms with unsteadiness. Migrainous vertigo and middle ear infections are considered to be the most common causes of childhood dizziness, while head injury and pathology of the central nervous system are less common causes. We present a case history of a 10-year-old girl with acute positional vertigo attacks. Investigations and treatment demonstrated that this patient had canalithiasis variant Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) in the lateral canal of the inner ear. The conventional view among many vestibular specialists is that childhood BPPV does not exist. We have demonstrated the opposite, and propose that childhood BPPV is more widespread than previously thought. We believe that children often spontaneously reposition dislodged otoconia through normal childhood play activities (e. g. tumbling, running, jumping, rolling etc.) thus avoiding the need to present for treatment with Epley and/ or Barbecue manoeuvres.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is an illusion of rotatory or linear movement that demonstrates a functional or lesional disturbance of the vestibular system, from periphery to central connections. According to the ANAES report (1997), benign paroxysmal positional vertical vertigo, vestibular neuronitis and Ménière's disease account for 40-50% of all mixed vertigo etiologies. Central etiologies may account for 20-40% of causes and 10-40% remain more difficult to classify, and are usually classified under the term of "peripheral vestibulopathy." These include vertigo due to neurovascular compression syndrome of the VIIIth nerve. Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and treatment of the main etiologies of vertigo will be developed in this chapter. A specific section will discuss the subject of neurovascular compression syndrome of the VIIIth nerve. Even though some publications should be challenged, it appears that neurovascular compression syndrome of the VIIIth nerve might explain some cases of vertigo or chronic instability, with or without cochlear signs. The diagnosis is difficult and must be established on multiple clinical, electrophysiological and radiological arguments. A therapeutic test with antiepileptic drugs is helpful. The treatment includes these drugs as a first option but may require a neurosurgical approach if medical treatment fails.</td>

All cases represented canalithiasis. Multiple-canal BPPV was rare, and usually involved canals on the same side; simultaneous involvement of the posterior and lateral canals was much more common than involvement of the anterior and posterior canals or the anterior and lateral canals. Trauma increased the risk for multiple-canal BPPV, but not the risk for bilateral single-canal BPPV. Cupulolithiasis was not a factor in multiple-canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Otolaryngologists typically perform diagnoses and offer medical treatment for vestibular dysfunction. This vestibular dysfunction manifests as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's disease, vestibular neuronitis, and so on. The etiology of BPPV is still not clear, so in this article we discuss inner-ear function, etiology, and factors related to BPPV. We examined by pure-tone audiometry and hot and cold caloric tests patients whom we identified as having diagnosed posterior canal-type BPPV. We observed canal paresis at a high rate on the affected side (p < .01). The term of recovery at the first treatment was longer in patients with canal paresis as compared to those without. Deterioration of hearing level was observed more frequently on the affected side (p < .01). The horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea are important potential sites of lesions affecting posterior canal-type BPPV, and the posterior circular canal and otolith are already considered to be sites of affecting lesions.</td>

	<td>Symptoms such as vertigo and unsteady gait occur in various diseases and are among the relatively common chief complaints. Even at present, the mechanisms underlying these disorders are unclear. We report a significant correlation between a prolonged period of resolution of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and histories of lifestyle-related illnesses. We consider the possibility of correlating between BPPV prognosis and arteriosclerotic changes. Using carotid ultrasonography, we examined maximum intima-media thickness (IMT), maximum common carotid artery IMT, and biochemical examinations in 105 patients with peripheral vertigo. We divided patients with BPPV into groups with and without abnormal thickness of the IMT. The maximum IMT was 1.35 mm in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. The proportion of peripheral vestibular disorder patients with a maximum IMT of > or = 1.1 mm (i.e., thickening) was 58%. The rate at which the feeling of positional vertigo remained at the halfway point in the observation period was significantly higher in the group of patients with an IMT of > or =1.1 mm (p = .0007). Our results indicate that cervical ultrasonography is useful for noninvasive examination of arteriosclerotic changes in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. We saw indications that such patients show progression of arteriosclerotic changes. This study suggested that the arteriosclerotic change was related to prognosis.</td>

Their positional nystagmus recorded by VNG in Dix-Hallpike and roll tests were analyzed to summarize the characteristics of nystagmus on nystagmography of various BPPV. Of 126 patients with BPPV diagnosed in our center, the posterior semicircular canals (PSC) were involved in 98 patients (77.8%), whereas the horizontal semicircular canal (HSC) and anterior semicircular canal (ASC) were involved in 17 (13.5%) and 5 (3.9%), respectively. Six patients (4.8%) confirmed combined-BPPV had HSC-BPPV and ipsilateral PSC-BPPV. Twenty-eight patients with PSC-BPPV had reversal phase on nystagmography. The nystagmus of patients with P/ASC-canalithiasis showed upward/downward on the vertical phase of nystagmography and orientated the opposite side on horizontal phase in the head hanging position, and the nystagmus reversed when returned to sit. Nystagmus on horizontal phase could be provoked when the head turned to both sides of the roll tests in patients with HSC-BPPV. If the nystagmus and the head-turning shared the same direction, then HSC-canalithiasis was confirmed, and the direction of the head-turning which provoked the stronger nystagmus indicates the lesion side. If the nystagmus and the head-turning had the opposite direction, then HSC-cupulolithiasis was confirmed, and the direction of the head-turning which provoked the weaker nystagmus indicates the lesion side. Positional nystagmus can be recorded objectively using VNG, According to which positioning the semicircular canal involved would be easier and more accurate. The recording conserved also could be helpful for clinical diagnosis and repositioning of BPPV.</td>

A survey was created based on previously validated and published curriculum needs assessment instruments for medical education. Surveys were distributed to (1) undergraduate directors of otolaryngology, (2) postgraduate program directors of family and emergency medicine at English-language medical schools, and (3) community otolaryngologists in Canada. There is large variation in the quantity of otolaryngology teaching in UME. Knowledge of otolaryngology is formally evaluated at half of the responding programs, although skills in otolaryngology are rarely tested. Clerkship rotations are not uniformly offered, and the length of these placements is limited. Opportunities in postgraduate training for formal education in otolaryngology are rare. Several important topics that are not uniformly taught include sudden sensorineural hearing loss, sleep apnea, and nasal trauma. Important skills that are not uniformly taught include treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and epistaxis. There is limited time for teaching otolaryngology in UME; therefore, it is essential to emphasize teaching key topics and skills, which are highlighted in the results of this study.</td>

	<td>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a calcium channelopathy due to a pathological CAG repeat expansion in CACNL1A4. Patients frequently describe paroxysmal vertigo early in the disease course, but it is not clear whether this is central or labyrinthine in origin. To address this issue we studied 21 SCA6 patients. Symptoms of vertigo were defined using a structured questionnaire. Signs were recorded during a standardised bed-side vestibular examination that included systematic positional testing with Frenzel goggles.Brief, recurrent attacks of vertigo occurred in 13 patients, usually preceding the onset of ataxia. Nystagmus was observed behind Frenzel goggles in 14 patients, and was induced either during positional testing, or head shaking in 20 patients. Only one patient had findings typical of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Combined downbeat and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus ("side-pocket") was the most common form, occurring most commonly in supine and head-hanging positions, and following horizontal head-shaking. Nystagmus beating away from the ground (apogeotropic) occurred in 9 patients as they lay on their side.In conclusion, vertigo and abnormalities on bedside vestibular examination are common in SCA6, with forms of nystagmus typical of cerebellar, rather than labyrinthine, disease. These findings demonstrate phenotypic overlap between SCA6 and episodic ataxia type 2, which are both due to mutations in CACNL1A4.</td>

The condition resolved spontaneously after several days. There have been reports of negative side effects in users of this equipment, such as dizziness, headache and a sensation of imbalance; however, there have been no reported cases involving vertigo. Based on a literature review, this equipment may cause side effects, including vertigo, by generating forces that can increase the original amplitude of internal organs, which may potentially cause labyrinthine trauma or dislocation of otoconia, leading to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. We suggest that whole-body vibration training plates may potentially induce benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Manufacturers may need to make users of this equipment aware of this risk, and remind them to use it with caution.</td>

	<td>Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder, especially in the elderly and presents as the predominant etiology in this population of the degeneration of the utricular macula. To compare the effectiveness of the approaches after Epley maneuver. longitudinal cohort. The study included 53 volunteers with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal, divided into Group 1, who underwent Epley maneuver associated with the use of neck collar and post-maneuver instructions, Group 2 underwent the Epley maneuver without the use cervical collar and/or post-maneuver restrictions, and Group 3 underwent the Epley maneuver associated with the use of a mini vibrator, without the use of neck collar and/or post-maneuver restrictions. In the three groups, the number of Epley maneuvers ranged from one to three. We employed the Brazilian Dizziness Handicap Inventory - pre-and post-treatment and observed a statistically significant difference on most scores pre-and post-treatment for both groups. Regardless of the post Epley maneuver treatment selected for the treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, it was effective when comparing the Brazilian Dizziness Handicap Inventory pre-and post-treatment.</td>

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness are symptoms which are reported frequently in clinical practice. We aimed to develop diagnostic indices for four prevalent vertiginous diseases: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Menière's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), and phobic postural vertigo (PPV). Based on a detailed questionnaire handed out to consecutive patients presenting for the first time in our dizziness clinic we preselected a set of seven questions with desirable diagnostic properties when compared with the final diagnosis after medical workup. Using exact logistic regression analysis diagnostic scores, each comprising of four to six items that can simply be added up, were built for each of the four diagnoses. Of 193 patients 131 questionnaires were left after excluding those with missing consent or data. Applying the suggested cut-off points, sensitivity and specificity were 87.5 and 93.5% for BPPV, 100 and 87.4% for MD, 92.3 and 83.7% for VM, 73.7 and 84.1% for PPV, respectively. By changing the cut-off points sensitivity and specificity can be adjusted to meet diagnostic needs. The diagnostic indices showed promising diagnostic properties. Once further validated, they could provide an ease to use and yet flexible tool for screening vertigo in clinical practice and epidemiological research.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most common disorders of the vestibular system. It is characterized by episodes of recurrent vertigo triggered by head movements or position changes associated with nystagmus. There is scientific evidence that in the majority of cases this condition responds well to the particle repositioning maneuver (PRM) correctly performed by the physician. However, the PRM needs to be repeated in approximately 30% of the cases. Although the maneuver is simple, patients often find it difficult to perform correctly as self-treatment, with the result that it fails to bring about an improvement in the symptoms. DizzyFix (Clearwater Clinical Limited, Canada) is the name given to a new dynamic visual device designed to provide a visual representation of the PRM based on the canalith theory. The DizzyFiX consists of a specially curved acrylic tube containing a nontoxic viscous fluid and a bead, the purpose of which is to help the patient and the inexperienced physician to perform the PRM correctly. A randomized clinical trial has shown that it reliably enables the maneuver to be performed correctly, and a study investigating the effectiveness of patient self-treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with the device in comparison with standard office treatment revealed both techniques to be equally effective. The device has now been approved by the US FDA.</td>

	<td>In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's ;chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is a common clinical manifestation in the emergency department (ED). It is important for physicians to determine if the peripheral cause of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a disorder accounting for 20% of all vertigo cases. However, the Dix-Hallpike test--the standard for BPPV diagnosis--is not common in the ED setting. If no central origin of the vertigo is determined, patients in the ED are typically treated with benzodiazepine, antihistamine, or anticholinergic agents. Studies have shown that these pharmaceutical treatment options may not be the best for patients with BPPV. The authors describe a case of a 38-year-old woman who presented to the ED with complaints of severe, sudden-onset vertigo. The patient's BPPV was diagnosed by means of a Dix-Hallpike test and the patient was acutely treated in the ED with physical therapy using the canalith repositioning maneuver.</td>

	<td>The diagnosis of lateral canalolithiasis is based on the typical finding of the horizontal paroxysmal positional nystagmus induced by the Pagnini-Mc Clure manoeuvre. This technique usually identifies also the affected side, namely, the side where the paroxysmal nystagmus is more intense in geotropic forms and the side where the paroxysmal nystagmus is less intense in apogeotropic forms. However, this method is not always applicable since, especially in apogeotropic forms, the intensity of the nystagmus is not so distinctly different between the two sides. Further useful signs to identify the affected side have been described in the Literature: Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus in the sitting position; Leaning and Bowing nystagmus; Null-point in the vertical plane; Sitting to supine positioning nystagmus; Null-point in the horizontal plane. They are fully explained at pathophysiological level by the mechanism of canalolithiasis, as they are caused by otoliths moving in the ampullopetal direction in the non-ampullary segment (geotropic canalolithiasis) of the lateral canal or in ampullofugal direction in the ampullary segment (apogeotropic canalolithiasis) of the lateral canal. In other words, the movement of otoliths determines excitatory or inhibitory endolymphatic flow that generates specific nystagmic eye-movements. Authors analyse the characteristics of these signs, that they define as "Secondary signs of lateralization", in 64 cases of apogeotropic lateral canalolithiasis. A decisive contribution of the "Secondary signs of lateralization" to diagnose the pathological side has been verified in 13 out of 64 cases, whereas, in all other cases, Pagnini-Mc Clure diagnostic manoeuvre proved successful in correctly identifying the affected side by itself. Among the "Secondary signs of lateralization", the Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus in the sitting position and the Sitting to the supine positioning nystagmus were particularly useful, due to both their frequency and their easy detection, as they do not require additional manoeuvres besides those usually performed during health examination of a patient affected by lateral canalolithiasis. In conclusion, the Authors propose a decision-making algorithm to diagnose and treat lateral canalolithiasis based on the attempt to obtain as much information as possible for a correct diagnosis, with the least trouble and inconvenience for patients.</td>

	<td>In summary, patients with BPPV can be treated with the canalith repositioning maneuver. Patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction can be treated using adaptation, substitution, and/or habituation exercises. Patients with motion sensitivity can demonstrate improved tolerance to motion after performing habituation exercises. Patients with bilateral vestibular loss will benefit from substitution and adaptation exercises. Each patient requires a treatment regime that is individualized and appropriate to address their impairments. Often the treatment is determined through the evaluation process. The task that causes the patient's complaints, whether it be dizziness, imbalance, and/or issues with eye-head coordination, often becomes the treatment of choice, gradually increasing difficulty as appropriate and safe. Patients with TBI who have concomitant vestibular dysfunction are a challenging population to treat. One has to be cognizant of cognitive deficits that may interfere with or prolong treatment as well as the many other neurological deficits that may be present because of the brain injury. For example, attempting to perform the canalith repositioning maneuver on a patient status post TBI when they are not able to comprehend the reasoning behind the treatment can lead to agitation or behavioral issues. Communication with the patient's primary doctor is a necessity so that the team is always on the same page about the approach to treatment. Vestibular evaluation and rehabilitation are a necessity for patients who have experienced a TBI. The sooner the problems are identified, the sooner treatment can be initiated with the goal of helping patients recover their maximal functional level of independence and safety. Also, treating patients with TBI and vestibular impairments can require increased treatment time in comparison to treatment of a patient with only vestibular dysfunction, so the sooner the treatment for vestibular dysfunction can be started, the better for the patient with TBI.</td>

Outpatient practice in a tertiary care facility. Patients (n = 118) with unilateral BPPV of the posterior canal, including 13 patients with BPPV of the lateral canal, were tested at a tertiary care center on one of five interventions: canalith repositioning maneuver (CRP), CRP plus home exercise, modified CRP, CRP for patients with involvement of two semicircular canals, and self-CRP home exercise. Self-CRP was also compared to previously published data on efficacy of the Brandt Daroff exercise. Main outcome measures were vertigo intensity and frequency, presence/absence of Dix-Hallpike responses, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL), and computerized dynamic posturography. Vertigo intensity and frequency and Dix-Hallpike responses decreased significantly, and posturography and VADL improved significantly from pre- to post tests. No other significant changes were found. The groups did not differ significantly. Vertigo intensity and frequency were not strongly related at pretest but were related at post-test. Length of illness and age did not influence the results. However the head is moved, as long as it is moved rapidly enough and through the correct planes in space, repositioning treatments are likely to be effective. Therefore, clinicians have a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited for each patient's unique needs.</td>

The observed frequency of rhinosinusitis was higher than predicted by survey data about the southern US region. The data trended toward higher prevalence of rhinosinusitis (by physician diagnosis) in the BPPV patients versus controls (58 vs. 39%, p = 0.06). BPPV patients have a higher frequency of sinus disease compared to people with normal vestibular systems, perhaps due to age differences, but physiologic factors may also be involved. The higher frequency of rhinosinusitis in this geographical area than reported rates based on survey data raises concerns about the usefulness of questionnaire data for estimating population prevalence.</td>

	<td>The mammalian otoconial membrane is a dense extracellular matrix containing bio-mineralized otoconia. This structure provides the mechanical stimulus necessary for hair cells of the vestibular maculae to respond to linear accelerations and gravity. In teleosts, Otolin is required for the proper anchoring of otolith crystals to the sensory maculae. Otoconia detachment and subsequent entrapment in the semicircular canals can result in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a common form of vertigo for which the molecular basis is unknown. Several cDNAs encoding protein components of the mammalian otoconia and otoconial membrane have recently been identified, and mutations in these genes result in abnormal otoconia formation and balance deficits. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of mammalian Otolin, a protein constituent of otoconia and the otoconial membrane. Otolin is a secreted glycoprotein of ∼70 kDa, with a C-terminal globular domain that is homologous to the immune complement C1q, and contains extensive posttranslational modifications including hydroxylated prolines and glycosylated lysines. Like all C1q/TNF family members, Otolin multimerizes into higher order oligomeric complexes. The expression of otolin mRNA is restricted to the inner ear, and immunohistochemical analysis identified Otolin protein in support cells of the vestibular maculae and semi-circular canal cristae. Additionally, Otolin forms protein complexes with Cerebellin-1 and Otoconin-90, two protein constituents of the otoconia, when expressed in vitro. Otolin was also found in subsets of support cells and non-sensory cells of the cochlea, suggesting that Otolin is also a component of the tectorial membrane. Given the importance of Otolin in lower organisms, the molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of the mammalian Otolin protein may lead to a better understanding of otoconial development and vestibular dysfunction.</td>

All other vascular risk factors tended to be more frequent in the former group although only a statistically significant difference was found for coronary artery disease (P = 0.03).

	<td>Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with the Epley and Semont maneuvers has been used with and without postmaneuver postural restrictions. Studies examining these restrictions have yielded differing results. This study sought to examine the studies for a more uniform conclusion. Controlled studies with objective identification of unilateral posterior semicircular canal BPPV and symptom resolution were analyzed. A PubMed search identified six studies totaling 523 patients meeting all inclusion criteria. Cohorts treated with and without restrictions were compared. Individual patient pooled analyses in a one-stage comparison were used for the meta-analysis. Pooled results of all restriction types showed no advantage over no restriction. Studies including each individual restriction were examined against the pooled population to look for technique differences. No restriction was found to be statistically significant. The restrictions examined in controlled trials did not differ significantly in clinical outcomes, which suggests that restrictions do not appear to significantly affect the efficacy of BPPV maneuvers.</td>

	<td>This review discusses the demographics of dizziness in the older person, the evaluation of the older dizzy patient and how the treatment of dizziness in older patients differs from that in younger individuals. Seven percent of all visits to primary care physicians for patients older than 65 years of age are for dizziness, and dizziness is the most common complaint for patients older than 75 years. In a German study, the 12-month prevalence of vertigo in the general population was 5% with an incidence of 1.4% in adults overall. For individuals aged 60-69 the 12-month prevalence was found to be 7.2% and in individuals 70 years of age or older 8.9%. Data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys indicated that the prevalence of vestibular dysfunction for individuals in the seventh decade of life, eighth decade of life, and older was 49.4, 68.7, and 84.8 percent, respectively. Only subtle age effects are seen on caloric and rotational testing whereas vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) change somewhat with age. Particle repositioning for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo combined with vestibular rehabilitation is more effective than only performing the repositioning maneuver. Tai Chi appears to be an effective intervention for older adults at risk for falling. When caring for an older dizzy patient always assess medication use, perform a Dix-Hallpike maneuver, obtain orthostatic vital signs, discuss fall risk precautions, and consider referral for vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

Fourteen cases were found with abnormal vertical phase, 1 case with abnormal vertical gain in a total of 21 vertical semicircular canal BPPV patients. Six cases with abnormal horizontal phase lead, 5 cases with abnormal horizontal gain, 2 cases with asymmetry were found in 12 patients with horizontal semicircular canal BPPV. Phase lead was abnormal in all frequencies in 4 patients, and in 2-3 Hz in 21 patients. 24 (58.54%) patients showed abnormal canal paresis (CP) and direction preference (DP) in caloric test. VAT can indicate information of vestibular function in both vertical and horizontal semicircular canal. Phase of VAT is constantly enhanced in BPPV, especially in 2-3 Hz. As the supplement of caloric test, VAT may prove helpful in assessment of semicircular canal function.</td>

The level of diacron reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) and circulating soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), were evaluated. As a treatment the patients were taught to perform the Brandt-Daroff exercise at home by themselves. The prognosis of BPPV, which is measured as the time until the disappearance of positional nystagmus by a physician during the outpatient visit each week, the relation among the level of oxygen metabolites, vascular molecule and the duration until remission were analyzed. The patients who required longer time for the disappearance of positional nystagmus showed high d-ROM and VCAM levels, whereas those who required shorter time for remission showed lower d-ROM and VCAM levels. There is an increased expression of VCAM-1 and d-ROM confirming the existence of an angiitis and supporting the vascular involvement in BPPV. The identification of the high levels of d-ROM and VCAM-1 can open the way to selective pharmacological treatments able to correct the oxidative stress and activation of endothelial cells.</td>

All patients were diagnosed using the Dix-Hallpike test and treated with the canalith repositioning procedure. The outcome of patients with t-BPPV was compared with patients with i-BPPV. Twenty-three of 186 patients with BPPV fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for t-BPPV. Women were affected i-BBPV more often than men (2.3:1), and women and men were equally affected t-BBPV (1:1). After one physical treatment, 34.8% of patients with t-BPPV had complete resolution of signs and symptoms in comparison to 85.3% of patients with i-BPPV (P < 0.05). During the 2-year follow-up, 56.5% of t-BPPV patients and 19.0% of i-BPPV patients had recurrent attacks (P < 0.05). The nature and severity of the traumas causing t-BPPV are diverse. It appears that t-BPPV is more difficult to treat than i-BPPV, and also has a greater tendency to recur.</td>

	<td>Review of office-based medical management options for common vestibular diseases. Basic science studies have defined the ionic homeostasis of the inner ear stria vascularis as a central principle in the understanding of inner ear disorders. New molecular channels for water homeostasis have been identified in the inner ear structures. Office-based history, neurotological physical examination and judicial use of audiovestibular testing have increased our ability to manage vestibular patients more cost-effectively. Clinical studies supported the use of gentamicin and steroids intratympanic perfusion of the inner ear to augment traditional treatments of common vestibular disorders. The molecular biology and ionic transport between the stria vascularis and endolymph provided further understanding to the pathology and treatment of inner ear disorders. The history, physical examination and judicial use of laboratory tests are very critical and cost-effective in managing patients with vestibular diseases. Treatments such as inner ear perfusion with gentamicin and steroids have helped control and stabilize vertigo and hearing loss in Meniere's disease. Canalith repositioning treatments and home-based vestibular rehabilitation have improved our abilities to effectively manage patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, uncompensated peripheral vestibular loss and multisensory deficit and age-related balance disorders.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether patients diagnosed with posterior canal (PC) BPPV, based on positional testing, and treated with a particle repositioning maneuver will show the resolution of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPN) on the Dix-Hallpike Test performed 24 hours or more after treatment. Data were obtained from an electronic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from 1966 through September 2009. The study topics were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, the diagnosis of PC BPPV, treatment with the particle repositioning maneuver, and outcome measured with a positional test 24 hours or more after treatment. Data extracted were study descriptors and the information used to code for effect size. In 2 double-blind RCTs, the odds in favor of the resolution of BPPN were 22 times (95% confidence interval=3.41-141.73) and 37 times (95% confidence interval=8.75-159.22) higher in people receiving the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) than in people receiving a sham treatment. This finding was supported by the results reported in 8 nonmasked quasi-RCTs. Studies with limited methodological quality suggested that a liberatory maneuver (LM) was more effective than a control intervention; there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the LM and the effectiveness of the CRP; the self-administered CRP was more effective than the self-administered LM; and the CRP administered together with the self-administered CRP was more effective than the CRP administered alone. The Brandt-Daroff exercises were the least effective self-administered treatments. The limitations included the methodological quality of the studies, the lack of quality-of-life measures, and confounding factors in reporting vertigo. Randomized controlled trials provided strong evidence that the CRP resolves PC BPPN, and quasi-RCTs suggested that the CRP or the LM performed by a clinician or with proper instruction at home by the patient resolves PC BPPN. There were no data on the effects of the maneuvers on outcomes relevant to patients.</td>

Intractable BPPV was defined in case of either a persistent nystagmus or a frequent relapse each lasting more than 1 year after the initial diagnosis. T2-weighted 3-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition sequences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reconstructed 3-dimensionally for 13 intractable BPPV patients and 14 control volunteers. Transition and relapse of nystagmus were monitored. Semicircular canals were evaluated for a stenosis or filling defect (obturation). Eighteen patients (4 with posterior canal type, 2 with horizontal canal type with geotropic nystagmus, and 12 with apogeotropic nystagmus) fulfilled the above criteria for intractability among 495 BPPV patients. The occurrence rate of intractable BPPV was 3.6%. Also, the rate of nystagmus transition was significantly higher in patients with geotropic nystagmus and the posterior canal type (100%) compared with those with apogeotropic nystagmus (33.3%). Of the 13 intractable BPPV patients who underwent MRI, 11 (84.6%) had a total of 23 canals with abnormal appearance (29.5%), showing a significantly higher incidence compared with controls. There was no correlation between the affected canal diagnosed by MRI and the type of nystagmus. The low incidence of nystagmus transition in patients with apogeotropic nystagmus suggests a difference in pathophysiology between apogeotropic nystagmus and other types of BPPV. Stenosis and filling defect (obturation) of canals on MRI, which would indicate an innate narrowing and/or an otoconial jam of the semicircular canal, may account for the intractability of BPPV.</td>

At each visit, the main diagnosis as to etiology, characteristics of the vertigo, its time-course, and patient demographic data were recorded. Of 547 cases, 17 diagnoses were made in 73.9%. Diagnostic categories included peripheral vertigo 72.9%, central vertigo 0.8%, psychogenic cause 0.2%, and unknown 26.1%. Common causes of vertigo were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) 52.5%, Meniere's disease 14.6%, and sudden idiopathic hearing loss 2.9%. Less common diagnoses were benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood 0.7%, labyrinthitis 0.7%, and vestibular schwannoma 0.3%. Rare conditions were delayed endolymphatic hydrops, Ramsey Hunt syndrome, otosyphilis, vestibular neuritis, temporal bone fracture, post-concussion syndrome, cerebellar infarction, epilepsy, cervical vertigo, Streptococcus suis meningitis, and psychogenic vertigo. Ninety-nine cases who reported remission of vertigo during the study period had median onset of the remission at 4 weeks. In the ear, nose, and throat clinic at Chiang Mai University, a tertiary university hospital, peripheral vestibular disorders were the main etiology of vertigo. The three most common causes were BPPV, Meniere's disease, and sudden idiopathic hearing loss. Half of the cases who returned for follow up had remitted symptoms within 4 weeks.</td>

Takotsubo is a round-bottomed, narrow-necked Japanese octopus trap and lends its name to takotsubo cardiomyopathy because of its resemblance to echocardiographic and ventricular angiographic images of the left ventricle in this condition. This appearance takes its source from peculiar, transient regional systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular segments. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo caused by peripheral vestibular dysfunction. The symptoms of BPPV are attributed to intralabyrinthine particles, presumed displaced otoconia. Thus, the treatment recommended for BPPV is head repositioning maneuvers. To present the first takotsubo cardiomyopathy case in the English literature related to BPPV undergoing canalith repositioning procedure.

MEDLINE (1966 to September 2007), Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were searched for articles with clinical relevance on topics concerning dizziness. Additional sources were also searched for clinical practice guidelines. The following information was abstracted from each article: year of publication, journal type, type of article and the topics of the article. Of nearly 3000 articles identified, 1244 articles met the inclusion criteria. The most common article type was a case report or case series, followed by expert opinion or review articles, studies of medical tests and clinical trials. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were found on benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Meniere's disease, but only a few other topics. No clinical practice guidelines were found that focus specifically on dizziness. The evidence base for the evaluation and management of dizziness seems to be weak. Future work to establish or summarize evidence in clinically meaningful ways could contribute to efforts to optimize patient care and health care utilization for one of the most common presenting symptoms.</td>

	<td>Osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE) is an often-used technique of great utility in certain implant patients with resorbed posterior maxilla. Recently benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been reported as an early postoperative complication following OSFE. Although OSFE-induced BPPV commonly resolves itself within a month without treatment, this complication can be a cause of trouble between the implant surgeon and patient. This report presents a case of BPPV following OSFE. A 27-year-old man without any significant medical problems and missing his maxillary right first molar, was scheduled for OSFE and simultaneous implant placement. The patient suffered dizziness accompanied by nausea immediately after implant placement using OSFE. Following referral to the ear nose throat clinic, "right posterior canal BPPV" was diagnosed. Despite anti vertigo medication and a single episode of the Epley maneuver, the condition did not improve completely. The Epley maneuver was then applied 7 and 8 days later and the symptoms of BPPV disappeared. One year later, the patient remained symptom-free. Before sinus elevation with an osteotome, implant surgeons should screen out patients with a history of vertigo, to diminish the possibility of BPPV. Operators should be aware of BPPV symptoms. As the symptoms may be very incapacitating, immediate referral to an otorhinolaryngologist is recommended.</td>

Prospective study of patients with disabling BPPV who failed conservative therapy. Patients noted to have been treated with at least three Epley maneuvers without success and continuing to have disabling symptoms were enrolled in this study. Patients underwent pre- and post-operative electronystagmography. The surgical technique is modified from Parnes1 and involves plugging each end of the fenestrated posterior semicircular canal with bone grafts and fibrin glue. The CO2 fiberoptic (Omniguide) laser is then used at a setting of 2 watts to incise between the cut ends of the canal to completely section the membranous labyrinth. All six patients had excellent relief of positional vertigo symptoms. LAPSCCA is an excellent treatment option for patients with intractable BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) of the anterior semicircular canal (ASC) is an uncommon disorder currently diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike (D-H) examination. According to the literature, nystagmus and vertigo may be more pronounced when the affected ear is either up or down. In some patients, both right and left D-H tests can trigger nystagmus with the same direction. The proposed treatment options with the addition of a different manoeuvre applied by the authors of the present study in cases of ASC lithiasis, seem to present a respective variety regarding the position of the affected ASC during the procedure of canalith repositioning. The aim of this study is to analyse the mechanisms underlying both the proposed treatment options and the clinical findings in the D-H examination. The results of this analysis stimulate further investigation, since they probably imply that repositioning manoeuvres might vary in their effectiveness when applied to different clinical subgroups of ASC BPPV.</td>

	<td>The prognostic significance of vertigo in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) remains a matter of debate because vertigo is associated with many different vestibular disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) as a prognostic factor in patients with SSNHL. We conducted a retrospective study of 298 patients with SSNHL. Hearing outcomes were evaluated by assessments of pre-treatment hearing and hearing gain. Comparative multivariate analyses between prognostic factors and hearing outcome were conducted. Thirty-eight (12.7%) SSNHL patients were found to also have BPPV. BPPV showed significant negative prognostic factors in hearing outcome on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.15). In comparison to average pure tone audiometry (PTA), patients diagnosed with SSNHL with BPPV exhibited poorer hearing in pre- and post-treatment PTA compared to SSNHL without BPPV. Old age (>60 years), pre-treatment hearing, and canal paresis were significant outcome predictors. BPPV in SSNHL patients, representing definitive vestibular damage, was closely related to poor prognosis.</td>

	<td>Horizontal semicircular canal (HSC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been reported to have a poorer prognosis than posterior semicircular canal BPPV. Incorrect determination of the affected ear appears to be one of the causes of poorer outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the "bow and lean test" (BLT) for proper determination of the affected ear followed by preferable treatment outcomes of HSC-BPPV. A prospective study. The 211 patients (225 cases) with HSC-BPPV were sequentially classified into two groups by hospital visiting time and diagnostic methods. The head roll test (HRT) group (61 cases) was treated with canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) on the basis of the results of HRT alone between 2001 and 2004. The BLT group (164 cases) was treated based on the results of both BLT and HRT from 2005 to 2008. The remission rates after two sessions of CRPs in the BLT group and the HRT group were 83.1% and 67.4% (P = .041), respectively, for the canalolithiasis type and 74.7% and 61.1% (P = .250), respectively, for the cupulolithiasis type. In the BLT group, 76.8% had bowing and/or leaning nystagmus; 35.7% of them (45 of 126 cases) benefited from BLT with regard to determining the affected ears because HRT was unable to provide the definitive affected ears (17 cases) or showed different localization between two methods (28 cases). BLT is a useful method to improve the remission rates of HSC-BPPV, giving more corrective information regarding affected ears than the HRT alone.</td>

We reviewed demographics, concurrent causative disorders, involved area, and response to particle repositioning maneuvers for these s-BPPV patients in comparison with i-BPPV subjects. Female subjects with i-BPPV outnumbered male subjects by a ratio of 1.9:1, but there was no significant sex difference for s-BPPV patients. The diseases associated with s-BPPV were idiopathic sudden sensory hearing loss (ISSHL, 50.7%), Ménière's disease (MD, 28.9%) and unilateral vestibulopathy such as acute vestibular neuronitis and herpes zoster oticus (20.2%). The posterior canal was most commonly involved in both i-BPPV and s-BPPV. The horizontal canal was the second most common, followed by multi-canal involvement. However, MD-associated BPPV most commonly involved the lateral canal. The mean durations of treatment for i-BPPV and s-BPPV were 2.28 and 4.87 days, respectively. The mean duration of treatment was 6.28 days for ISSHL with BPPV, 5.07 days for BPPV with unilateral vestibulopathy, and 2.28 days for BPPV with MD. The mean duration of treatment for BPPV with ISSHL or unilateral vestibulopathy was longer than for other groups. The different pathophysiologies of s-BPPV associated with different inner ear diseases may explain its diverse clinical features and courses.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is characterized by brief recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. BPPV is the most common etiology of recurrent vertigo and is caused by abnormal stimulation of the cupula by free-floating otoliths (canalolithiasis) or otoliths that have adhered to the cupula (cupulolithiasis) within any of the three semicircular canals. Typical symptoms and signs of BPPV are evoked when the head is positioned so that the plane of the affected semicircular canal is spatially vertical and thus aligned with gravity. Paroxysm of vertigo and nystagmus develops after a brief latency during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver in posterior-canal BPPV, and during the supine roll test in horizontal-canal BPPV. Positioning the head in the opposite direction usually reverses the direction of the nystagmus. The duration, frequency, and symptom intensity of BPPV vary depending on the involved canals and the location of otolithic debris. Spontaneous recovery may be expected even with conservative treatments. However, canalithrepositioning maneuvers usually provide an immediate resolution of symptoms by clearing the canaliths from the semicircular canal into the vestibule.</td>

To study a large number of VN patients longitudinally to identify the recurrence rate of VN and incidence of BPPV, other peripheral vestibular disorders, sudden hearing loss or Bell's palsy. This prospective cohort study assessed a VN patient-based clinic population. All patients received a complete bedside clinical examination and caloric irrigation. Long-term (range 4-6 years, mean 4.9 years) longitudinal follow-up examination of 51 VN patients demonstrated a low recurrence rate (1/51 patients, 2.0%). With recurrence, VN affected the same ear after 6 months and caused less severe symptoms. BPPV appears to be more frequent (5/51 patients, 9.8%) in VN patients than in the general population, consistently affecting the posterior canal of the same ear. BPPV occurrence after VN predominantly affects VN patients who did not fully recover from the disease. Moreover, BPPV after VN appears to be more difficult to treat than idiopathic BPPV.</td>

	<td>To explore the clinical value of different positioning tests for different benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This research applies Dix-Hallpike test and Side-lying test for PC-BPPV, Roll test and WRW test for HC-BPPV, Dix-Hallpike test, Side-lying test and Rahko T maneuvers for SC-BPPV. Six hundred and thirteen cases, who were tested with different positioning tests in the sequence of firstly PC-BPPV then HC-BPPV and finally SC-BPPV, were randomly divided into 2 groups. The order of positioning tests for PC-BPPV and HC-BPPV in the two groups was reversed. There's no significant difference between the detection rate of Dix-Hallpike test and Side-lying test for PC-BPPV (P > 0.05). Similarly, there's no difference in statistics between the detection rate of Roll test and WRW test for HC-BPPV (P > 0.05). However, the detection rate of Rahko T maneuver was higher than the other two tests for SC-BPPV and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The detection rates of different positioning tests for PC-BPPV and HC-BPPV between the two groups were not different in statistics (P > 0.05), which implies that the different order had no effect on the sensitivity of each positioning test. Dix-Hallpike test is recommended as the first choice for PC-BPPV for its more efficient stimulus to the posterior semicircular canal, and Side-lying test is recommended as a prior choice to the patients with suspected PC-BPPV but unable to receive Dix-Hallpike test because of its similar sensitivity and more convenient manipulation. The detection rate of Both Roll test and WRW test were higher than 90% and there's no significant difference between the two tests. In addition, Roll test is easier to perform and helpful for the therapy, so its considered as the preferred test for HC-BPPV with WRW test as the supplement test. Nevertheless, for SC-BPPV the sensitivity of Rahko T maneuver was higher than that of the other two tests, so it can be used to confirm the suspected SC-BPPV patients detected or missed diagnosed by the two other tests. To avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, the judgment of affected semicircular canal is determined not only by positioning test but also by the feature of nystagmus.</td>

It may lead to a specific form of vertigo known as BPPV or top-shelf vertigo. A careful scaling of the physical and geometrical parameters allows us to study the mechanics of this disease on an enlarged model of a single semicircular canal with laser vibrometry and video particle tracking. Early results confirm the proper operation of the model canal and support the current theories on the mechanisms of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Postural restrictions are probably not necessary after the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP). Epley reported the effect of CRP for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). After CRP, patients are often requested to restrict postural change. However, some studies suggested that CRP may work without postural restrictions. The present study aimed to determine the necessity of post-maneuver postural restriction using the frog labyrinth model. The otoconial mass from the sacculus was placed on the utricular macular otoconia, mimicking a condition after CRP. The stability of the otoconial mass was observed by tilting the preparation, immediately, 3 min, and 5 min after it was placed on the macular otoconia. The utricular macula was maintained in the vertical plane for 10 s, during which period the behavior of the otoconial mass was observed. In experiment 1 the utricular macula was intact, in experiment 2 otoconia were partially removed, and in experiment 3 they were totally removed from the macula. In experiments 1 and 2, in all preparations the otoconial mass became stabilized after 3 min. Even in experiment 3, in most preparations the otoconial mass became stabilized after 5 min.</td>

A retrospective study design consiting of reviews of charts of BPPV patients in a vestibular rehabilitation unit at a teaching institution in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, from 2007 to 2008. Pre- and post-therapy (Epley's repositioning maneuver) scores on the physical, functional and emotional dimensions of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) were analyzed. Twenty-one patients were included, eighteen (86%) were females; the average age was 53.2 years. Ten patients presented bilateral BPPV; in eleven it was unilateral. The mean interval between assessments (pre- and post-treatment) was 21 days. The average number of required maneuvers was 2.3 (±1.1). Pre-treatment DHI results showed a significant impact of BPPV on quality of life. Initial scores for physical (17.5), functional (17.3), emotional (13.2) dimensions decreased with therapy: respectively 3.7, 3.9, and 3.2 (p<0.001). In the present sample, Epley's maneuver had a positive and significant effect on emotional, physical and functional dimensions of quality of life, as measured by the DHI scores before and after therapy.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between post-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) dizziness and orthostatic hypotension (OH) using the head-up tilt test (HUTT). Twenty-nine patients previously affected by BPPV and successfully underwent repositioning maneuvers were tested using the HUTT. Our data do not show a statistically significant relationship between OH and the persistence of balance disorders after recovery from BPPV; anyway the prevalence of OH in the overall sample (34%) and in subjects affected by balance disorders after recovery (40%), was higher than in the general population. it is reasonable to hypothesize that OH plays a role in the genesis of orthostatic dizziness that patients commonly experience after recovery from BPPV. To improve the sensitivity of the HUTT, it would be advisable to use non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring. Although we feel that additional data are needed, we believe that the present work underlines the importance of considering anomalies of the autonomic system in the differential diagnosis of dizziness and could offer the basis for further studies about the role of sympathetic reflexes in those cases of persistence of symptoms after recovery from BPPV.</td>

A review of the international literature confirms the existence of such a problem, and permits to underline the scarcity of connections between otology and neurotology, on one hand, and principles of basic sciences and general and internal medicine, on the other hand: this can explain some therapeutic contradictions in treating inner ear disorders, their frequent labelling as idiopathic and the persisting uncertainties concerning a correct diagnostic and therapeutic management. In order to overcome the difficulties deriving to insufficient interdisciplinary cooperation, the institution of hospital audiovestibular services with a strictly linked net of cooperation with internal medicine units could represent a progress. This could help prevent clinically and economically inadequate management, contributing to minimize the possibility of expensive and/or health-threatening mistakes; moreover, it could represent an example to easily improve the practical aspects of both pre graduate and postgraduate curricula, and to form more open-minded clinicians, starting both from an ear.

	<td>Dizziness accounts for an estimated 5 percent of primary care clinic visits. The patient history can generally classify dizziness into one of four categories: vertigo, disequilibrium, presyncope, or lightheadedness. The main causes of vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere disease, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Many medications can cause presyncope, and regimens should be assessed in patients with this type of dizziness. Parkinson disease and diabetic neuropathy should be considered with the diagnosis of disequilibrium. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and hyperventilation syndrome, can cause vague lightheadedness. The differential diagnosis of dizziness can be narrowed with easy-to-perform physical examination tests, including evaluation for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and orthostatic blood pressure testing. Laboratory testing and radiography play little role in diagnosis. A final diagnosis is not obtained in about 20 percent of cases. Treatment of vertigo includes the Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning) and vestibular rehabilitation for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, intratympanic dexamethasone or gentamicin for Meniere disease, and steroids for vestibular neuritis. Orthostatic hypotension that causes presyncope can be treated with alpha agonists, mineralocorticoids, or lifestyle changes. Disequilibrium and lightheadedness can be alleviated by treating the underlying cause.</td>

To evaluate the effectiveness of Epley's manoeuvre (EM) in the treatment of BPPV using a critical review of the medical literature and a meta-analysis. Searches were made in the databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), in the Cochrane collection (Cochrane Register of controlled studies), BIREME and LILACS (all of them up to December 2008). The search words used were: canalith repositioning procedure, canalith repositioning manoeuvre, Epley manoeuvre, Dix-Hallpike, benign vertigo, benign positional vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and BPPV. The meta-analysis was performed using the program RevMan 5.0. The patients on whom an EM was performed had a six and half times more chance of their clinical symptoms improving compared to the control group of patients (OR=6.52; 95% CI, 4.17-10.20). Similarly, the likelihood of having a negative Dix-Hallpike (DH) test are 5 times greater in patients had the EM performed than in those who did not (OR=5.19; 95% CI, 2.41-11.17). The EM is effective in controlling BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common form of dizziness. The causes of BPPV are not yet known but a relationship between the onset of vertigo and head trauma has been found. Among the causes of head injury related to BPPV, dropping off a camel has not been reported in literature yet. We describe two cases of persons that fell off a camel during a safari in Middle East countries. After the fall they reported vertigo symptoms that were not interpreted as BPPV. When they returned to Italy, due to symptoms persistence, they were referred to our ENT practice: we found evidence of BPPV. In a case it was a bilateral BPPV (bBPPV). Falling off a camel may be a relevant cause of BPPV. We suggest a correct evaluation of the labyrinth for BPPV with the appropriate diagnostic maneuvers and, if necessary, a treatment with repositioning maneuvers.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the commonest peripheral vestibular causes of vertigo. The particle repositioning manoeuvre (Epley's manoeuvre) has become the 'gold standard' treatment for this disorder. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can affect any age group but is commoner in older patients. Cervical spine problems (e.g. spondylosis and disc prolapse) are commoner in this age group. Epley's manoeuvre necessitates passive neck movements. Such movements may not be wise in patients at risk of cervical spine fracture. This study included 40 patients complaining of vertigo and diagnosed as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A new particle repositioning manoeuvre was designed for these patients, as an alternative to Epley's manoeuvre. At one week review, 36 patients (90 per cent) reported total relief from vertigo. Three patients reported a major improvement in their vertigo, and their residual vertigo was relieved by performing the new manoeuvre again after two weeks. Further clinical reviews at one month, three months, six months and one year found that seven patients had suffered minor attacks of typical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo after three months. All seven were relieved of their symptoms after undergoing the new particle repositioning manoeuvre again. The proposed new manoeuvre is simple, effective and safe for treating patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and cervical spine problems.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common disorder caused by the dislocation of otoconia most commonly into the posterior canal. The primary symptoms are brief episodes of head-position related vertigo which may be accompanied by nausea and disequilibrium. BPPV is usually managed conservatively with excellent results, however in a small number of cases the symptoms can become persistent and incapacitating. The most common treatment in such cases involves the surgical occlusion of the canal. This procedure carries a small risk of post operative perilymph leakage via an iatrogenic fistula. In this paper we outline a case of a patient who developed a perilymph leak following occlusion surgery for intractable BPPV. We describe a novel surgical method that was used to close the fistula using a synthetic polymer based patch (TissuePatchDural90™), which has not been applied in the field of otology previously. </td>

Surgery for vestibular disorders is less often indicated at present. Office-administered intratympanic gentamicin and steroid treatment have been found to be effective for control of vertigo in Meniere's disease. Side-effects of this treatment are overall acceptable. Surgery may be considered for Meniere's disease patients with good hearing who have failed intratympanic steroid treatment.

	<td>Dizziness is not an uncommon complaint in the Otolaryngological clinics among other symptoms. To a large number of practitioners, the treatment of dizziness remains the same irrespective of the etiology, i.e., anti-vertiginous drugs. The objective of this study was to document the evaluation, causes and treatment of vestibular disorders among our patients. The design includes descriptive prospective study conducted in the Oto-rhino-laryngology and Orthopedic Clinics of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos and Nigerian Army Audiological Centre, 68 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital, Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria. Adult patients referred to the audiology clinic for dizziness had detailed history obtained by using structured questionnaire. General physical and neuro-otological examinations were done. Clinical diagnoses were made on standardized criteria. The patients had hearing evaluation, videonystagmography (VNG) evaluation using infrared videonystagmography system. X-ray of the cervical spine and computerized tomogram scan of internal auditory meatus and brain when indicated were done. A total of 102 patients were seen with age range between 21 and 90 years. Thirty patients (29.4%) recorded average duration of episode of vertiginous attacks in seconds, 69 (67.6%) recorded within minutes to hours and 3 (2.9%) with no definite pattern. Clinical signs on neuro-otological examination were elicited on 39 (38.2%) of the patients while on VNG the vestibular subtest mainly caloric test was abnormal unilaterally and bilaterally in 47 (46.1%) while with the oculomotor subtests, smooth pursuit tests were abnormal in 5 (6.9%), saccade tests were abnormal in 8 (7.8%) and OPK were abnormal in 9 (8.8%). Peripheral vestibular disorders are common of which benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was seen in 29 (28.4%), Meniere's disease in 22 (21.6%), recurrent vestibulopathy in 20 (19.6%), cervical vertigo in 18 (17.6%), psychogenic vertigo in 2 (2%), vestibular schwannoma, barotraumas and drug-induced vertigo in 1 (1%), respectively, central vestibular disorders of vascular origin 2 (2%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency in 1 (1%), post-traumatic vertigo in 3 (3%) and unknown in 2 (2%). In conclusion, peripheral vestibular disorders are common of which BPPV is the most prevalent. Pre-referral anti-vertiginous medication is common among general practitioners. The practising ORL/Head neck surgeon and orthopedic surgeons must be conversant with the tools of diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment.</td>

Case-control study of new patients presenting to a tertiary neuro-otologic practice. A total of 46 subjects with idiopathic dizziness (ID), 20 positive controls with dizziness (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPV]), and 69 negative controls with hearing loss (HL) but no dizziness were enrolled. Participants who were patients diagnosed with the above conditions and who met all other inclusion criteria completed a sleep questionnaire and had a complete physical exam and investigations to establish or exclude a neuro-otologic diagnosis. They were subsequently evaluated for risk of symptomatic sleep disturbance based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Berlin Questionnaire, and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). There was no significant demographic difference among the groups in terms of age, sex, body mass index, neck size, alcohol consumption, or smoking. Using a cutoff of both 10 and 12 on the ESS, the ID were more likely to have significant daytime somnolence than the HL group, with a likelihood ratio (LR) of 7.8 for the ESS 12 score (P = .021) and 7.1 for the ESS 10 score (P = .029). Using the MAP score, a statistically significant difference between the ID group and both the BPV group (LR 3.99, P = .046) and the HL group (LR 5.46, P = .019) was found. This study suggests that a previously undescribed link between idiopathic dizziness, daytime somnolence, and sleep apnea might exist. Prospective investigation is warranted to determine whether treatment of any sleep issues resolves symptoms of idiopathic dizziness.</td>

The investigation was made one hour after the positive Dix-Hallpike test, 10 and 20 days after the treatment with EM. "Sway velocity" (SV) was calculated to evaluate postural stability. The results show dependence between efficacy of treatment with betahistine applied after EM and duration of BPPV. Betahistine normalized postural stability of patients with duration of BPPV less than 60 days after 10 days of treatment and had less effect on patients with duration of BPPV above 60 days. We assume that after removing the otoconia betahistine plays an important role for improving blood flow in the inner ear. The short presence of otoconia didn't damage sensory receptor, and restoring the normal function of motion-sensitive hairs cells and stabilizing the posture was observed.</td>

	<td>Vestibular migraine is a chameleon among the episodic vertigo syndromes because considerable variation characterizes its clinical manifestation. The attacks may last from seconds to days. About one-third of patients presents with monosymptomatic attacks of vertigo or dizziness without headache or other migrainous symptoms. During attacks most patients show spontaneous or positional nystagmus and in the attack-free interval minor ocular motor and vestibular deficits. Women are significantly more often affected than men. Symptoms may begin at any time in life, with the highest prevalence in young adults and between the ages of 60 and 70. Over the last 10 years vestibular migraine has evolved into a medical entity in dizziness units. It is the most common cause of spontaneous recurrent episodic vertigo and accounts for approximately 10% of patients with vertigo and dizziness. Its broad spectrum poses a diagnostic problem of how to rule out Menière's disease or vestibular paroxysmia. Vestibular migraine should be included in the International Headache Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) as a subcategory of migraine. It should, however, be kept separate and distinct from basilar-type migraine and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood. We prefer the term "vestibular migraine" to "migrainous vertigo," because the latter may also refer to various vestibular and non-vestibular symptoms. Antimigrainous medication to treat the single attack and to prevent recurring attacks appears to be effective, but the published evidence is weak. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is required to evaluate medical treatment of this condition.</td>

	<td>We propose that the rolling-over maneuver (ROM) is as effective as the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRP) for the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). ROM involves easy movements, with only a small load. This therapy is suitable for most BPPV patients, even for those without an indication for CRP. BPPV is a common vestibular disorder. CRP is known to be an effective therapy for the treatment of BPPV. Because of its various movements of the head and body, it is impossible to perform CRP in BPPV patients with orthopedic impairments or in the elderly. For these patients, we perform a maneuver called ROM, which involves easy movements. In this study, we compared the efficacy of ROM with that of CRP in patients with posterior semicircular canal-type BPPV. The study included 22 patients with BPPV who were randomized and divided into the following 2 groups: 1) those treated by the modified Epley maneuver as CRP; and 2) those treated by ROM. We found no significant difference between the two groups in the number of days from onset to remission of both nystagmus and vertigo.</td>

Data from 100 patients with MD, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), or unilateral peripheral vestibular impairment (UPVI) were analyzed with respect to vestibular diagnosis and migraine as a secondary diagnosis. Spontaneous attacks of vertigo or unsteadiness occurred in 74% and 48% of patients, respectively. Vertigo was significantly more often reported in patients with MD and BPPV. In patients with BPPV, the duration of spontaneous vertigo was shorter than in patients with MD. The relative incidence of other symptoms were: unsteadiness, 48%; 'stepping into a hole', 46%; lateropulsion, 35%; 'walking on pillows', 21%; and drop attacks, 19%. Only the sensation of static tilt, which occurred in 8% of patients, was significantly correlated to MD or to migraine.</td>

	<td>To study the relationship between disability and health-related quality of life in women with vertigo of peripheral origin. Cross-sectional study in 26 women diagnosed with vertigo, classified by type of peripheral vestibular disturbance: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, post-trauma and others. In a self-report interview, a 12-item short-form (SF-12) health survey on quality of life was applied; disability was assessed with the questionnaire "Dizziness Handicap Inventory" (DHI). Measures of central tendency, dispersion for the domains and types of vestibular disturbance were used and internal DHI consistency and inter-scale correlation were calculated. Patients in the vestibular neuritis and Ménière groups displayed a higher level of disability according to the DHI functional (29.5+/-5.5 vs. 27.0+/-8.8) and physical domains (23.0+/-4.1 vs. 21.5+/-6.6). Based on the SF-12 domains, greater deterioration in quality of life was perceived in physical (22.9+/-3.9 vs. 22.6+/-4.6) and emotional performance (15.4+/-5.0 vs. 11.3+/-6.0), respectively. Acceptable and significant inverse correlations were found between the physical component summary (PCS-12) of the SF-12 and the physical, emotional and functional aspects of the DHI questionnaire (r=-0.51 to -0.78, p<0.01). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha index) of the DHI questionnaire was appropriate for the sample. The DHI and the SF-12 are useful, practical and valid instruments for assessing the impact of dizziness on the quality of life of patients with this symptom.</td>

Our study group included 146 patients with a diagnosis of p-BPPV. All patients underwent the new manoeuvre, which consisted of several high-acceleration successive head movements in the horizontal plane performed by the same physician. The results of the study group were compared with those of a sham control group of 30 patients with p-BPPV undergoing placebo treatment. The patients of both groups were reviewed in a follow-up appointment 1 month and 1 year after the initial treatment. Complete resolution of symptoms immediately after the manoeuvre was observed in 92% of patients. At 1-month and 1-year follow-up assessment, all the patients in the study group reported complete relief from their symptoms compared with only 13% and 43% of control patients respectively. Recurrence of symptoms was reported in 12 patients (8%) from the study group, who responded successfully to one additional session. This study establishes the efficacy of the new manoeuvre in the short- and long-term management of p-BPPV. It is a quick office procedure, usually resolving this disorder with a single session, although there some limitations in patients with underlying cervical spine pathology.</td>

In all 29 patients the BPPV origin was attributed to posterior canal involvement; 24 (82.8%) were idiopathic, 4 with a history of Ménière's disease, and 1 secondary to head trauma; 18 (62.1%) were right-side involved; and 25 (86.2%) were diagnosed previously as vertebral-basilar insufficiency. Cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and the correlative risk factors were common both in patients with BPPV and those with non-BPPV dizziness. Twenty-one patients underwent Epley's maneuver, all were free of vertigo after treatment, 14 of them after a single session and the remaining 2 to 4 sessions. No significant complications were observed except in one who experienced vomiting during the procedure. Patients who received Epley's maneuver had a higher cure rate and short recovery time than those who did not. BPPV is not uncommon in very old patients with dizziness. Clinicians should have the knowledge to diagnose and treat this condition. Epley's maneuver is safe and effective in very old patients with BPPV.</td>

A total of 48 patients with BPPV of posterior semicircular canal in vertigo clinic of our hospital from May 2007 to December 2008 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. All patients underwent the inspection of caloric test, static posturography, and dynamic posturography. The vestibular tests were performed at two different time points: at onset when patients had typical nystagmus provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver before treatment with the Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning maneuver, CRM), and at one week after treatment with CRM as their nystagmus disappeared. And results at theses two time points were compared. Eight patients whose dynamic balances were still abnormal after CRM accepted vestibular rehabilitation exercise using dynamic posturography, and re-examined 3 weeks later with dynamic posturography. Among 48 cases of BPPV, the abnormal rates of caloric test, static posturography, and dynamic posturography before CRM were 25.0%, 33.3% and 70.8%, respectively. The abnormal rate of dynamic posturography was much higher than that of caloric test or static posturography, and the differences were statistically significant (χ² = 4.84, 7.88; P < 0.05). After CRM, the abnormal rates of caloric test, static posturography, and dynamic posturography were 14.6%, 8.3% and 16.7%, respectively. After CRM, the abnormal rate of static and dynamic posturography showed significant reduction (χ² = 24.04, 10.08; P < 0.05), however, the results of caloric test showed no significant change (χ² = 3.20, P > 0.05). Eight patients whose dynamic balances were still abnormal after CRM, accepted vestibular rehabilitation exercise lasting 3 weeks using dynamic posturography. The dynamic balances were all improved to normal after vestibular rehabilitation. Dynamic posturography can quantitatively analyze postural balance, and is helpful in comprehensive evaluation of the vestibular function of BPPV patients. Impaired balance often presents in patients with BPPV. Treatment of BPPV using the canalith repositioning maneuver results in improved postural stability in static and dynamic posturography. However, not all patients have normal dynamic stability after successful CRM. The vestibular rehabilitation exercise using dynamic posturography is a helpful adjunct to the treatment for these patients.</td>

The patient in this study complained significant sound-induced vertigo and autophony in his right ear. The axis of nystagmus was orthogonal to the lateral semicircular canal, and no torsional or vertical motions were observed, so pathology of the lateral semicircular canal was preferentially considered. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was excluded since vertigo attacks had no relation to the change of head position. The dehiscence of the right lateral semicircular canal was then confirmed through the high-resolution temporal bone computer tomography scan and the reconstructed images. The cause of the LSCD is poorly understood, since no history of head trauma, otological infection or surgery was documented.</td>

	<td>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been reported to be a common cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, only a few studies have investigated BPPV after TBI. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of BPPV after TBI and to determine whether there are clinical differences between BPPV after TBI and idiopathic BPPV. The authors reviewed the medical records of 192 consecutive patients with positional vertigo after head injury during the period 2003 to 2009 and investigated 112 patients with idiopathic BPPV treated over the same period. The clinical characteristics of BPPV after TBI and the clinical differences between the traumatic BPPV and idiopathic BPPV groups were investigated. A total of 32 patients with BPPV after TBI fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four patients in the traumatic BPPV group had posterior semicircular canal-BPPV and 11 patients lateral semicircular canal-BPPV. A total of 58 repositioning maneuver sessions were performed in these 32 patients. Members of the traumatic BPPV group required more treatment sessions than members of the idiopathic group (p<0.05), but no tendency to recur was observed in the traumatic group (p>0.05). Recurrence rates in the traumatic and idiopathic BPPV groups were 15.6% and 18.8%, respectively (p>0.05). It is likely that BPPV after TBI is more difficult to treat than idiopathic BPPV, but no tendency to recur was observed in patients who developed BPPV after TBI compared with idiopathic BPPV. Further prospective clinical meta-analytic studies are needed to investigate the outcome of BPPV after TBI.</td>

We found nine papers dealing with BPPV without nystagmus, whose diagnoses were based solely on clinical history and physical examination. The treatment of BPPV without nystagmus was made by Epley maneuvers, Sémont, modified releasing for posterior semicircular canal and Brandt-Daroff exercises. From 50% to 97.1% of the patients with BPPV without nystagmus had symptom remission, while patients with BPPV with nystagmus with symptom remission ranged from 76% to 100%. These differences may not be significant, which points to the need for more studies on BPPV without nystagmus.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common peripheral vestibular disorder encountered in primary care and specialist otolaryngology and neurology clinics. It is associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus, which can be elicited with specific diagnostic positional maneuvers, such as the Dix-Hallpike test and the supine roll test. Current clinical research focused on diagnosing and treating various types of BPPV, according to the semicircular canal involved and according to the implicated pathogenetic mechanism. Cases of multiple-canal BPPV have been specifically investigated because until recently these were resistant to treatment with standard canalith repositioning procedures. Probably, the most significant factor in diagnosis of the type of BPPV is observation of the provoked nystagmus, during the diagnostic positional maneuvers. We describe in detail the various types of nystagmus, according to the canals involved, which are the keypoint to accurate diagnosis.</td>

This vestibular syndrome is characterized by transient attacks of vertigo, caused by change in head position, and associated with paroxysmal characteristic nystagmus. The symptoms result from movement of the free floating otoconia particles in the endolymph or their attachment to the cupulae of the semicircular canal. The diagnosis is essentially clinical and should be confirmed by performing diagnostic maneuvers. Treatment is based on the identification of the affected semicircular canal and performance of liberatory maneuvers or repositioning of free floating particles of otoliths.

A subset of BRV is associated with migraine. To investigate whether clinical features of vertigo attacks can distinguish patients with BRV from those with Meniere's disease and whether subtypes of BRV can be identified. A structured interview was used to analyze features in patients with BRV, i.e. those who have normal audiograms and caloric test results even though they have had recurrent vertigo (n = 63). A group of patients with definite Meniere's disease (n = 112) served as the comparison group. Compared with the Meniere's disease group, patients with BRV had a female preponderance, earlier age of onset, and increased incidence of migraine headaches (IHS criteria). With regard to the vertigo attacks, duration tended to be shorter in patients with BRV but there was a large overlap in the duration of attacks between the two groups. Triggers (stress/emotional upset, fatigue, menstrual periods) and associated symptoms (imbalance, nausea and vomiting, headache, sensitivity to light) were not significantly different in the two groups.</td>

	<td>Both migraine and dizziness/vertigo rank among the most common complaints in the general population. Worldwide, the lifetime prevalence of migraine is about 14%. Approximately 20% to 30% of the general population are affected by dizziness and vertigo. Given the high prevalence of vertigo and migraine in the general population it is not surprising that many patients suffer from both symptoms. Nonetheless, in the last decade epidemiological arguments have progressively accumulated to strengthen the hypothesis that vertigo is linked to migraine beyond a mere chance concurrence. Several studies with selected patient groups have shown that the prevalence of vertigo is increased in patients with migraine. Vice versa, patients presenting to a dizziness clinic have a history of migraine more often than would be expected by chance. The epidemiological link between vertigo and migraine has recently been confirmed on the population level. The relation between vertigo and migraine is intricate. In vestibular migraine, vertigo is conceptualized as a vestibular symptom caused by migraine. Vestibular migraine is the most common cause for recurrent spontaneous vertigo with a lifetime-prevalence in the general population of about 1%. Other vestibular disorders that display an increased prevalence of migraine are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Menière's disease. Furthermore, migraine is associated with motion sickness, rare ataxia disorders and psychiatric syndromes that can also manifest with vertigo and dizziness.</td>

	<td>Presently, the unambiguous diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) requires the detection of positioning or positional nystagmus provoked by Dix-Hallpike (for vertical semicircular canals) or supine roll (for horizontal semicircular canals) manoeuvres, which indicates canalo- or cupolithiasis of affected semicircular canals. There are patients, however, in whom--despite typical complaints of BPPV--no positional nystagmus can be documented; this is called 'subjective BPPV' (sBPPV). These patients usually complain of short vertigo spells during and after sitting up, sometimes with abnormal retropulsion of the trunk. In this study, the authors aimed to ascertain whether these patients in fact demonstrate abnormal sitting-up trunk oscillations when measured by posturography. Of 200 unselected patients with vertigo or dizziness, 43% had sBPPV with vertigo spells while sitting up, and 20% classical BPPV. Posturographic recordings were performed in 20 patients with sBPPV and sitting-up vertigo. Seven of the 20 patients had trunk oscillations during the act of sitting up and for a short time immediately afterwards. Based on their findings, the authors propose a new type of BPPV, the so-called Type 2 BPPV (typical complaints of BPPV, no nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike positions but short vertigo spell while sitting up), which may be the result of chronic canalolithiasis within the short arm of a posterior canal. Furthermore, the authors suggest that Type 2 BPPV, which could be identical to sBPPV or constitute a major subgroup of it, occurs frequently among patients with vertigo. For therapy, the authors recommend repetitive sit-ups from the Dix-Hallpike positions to liberate the short arm of the posterior canal from canaloliths.</td>

The data of these patients, collected from the medical records between January 2010 and January 2011, were reviewed and analyzed. From one hundred and forty-nine cases, 49 cases (33%) were men and 100 cases (67%) were women, which yielded the male-to-female ratio of 1:2. The average age of patients was 55 year olds. The most common diagnostic category was peripheral vestibular disorders (80.5%). Other causes were central vestibular disorders (4.7%) and non-vestibular related (4%), whereas the remaining (10.1%) was undiagnosed. The causes of vertigo included benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: BPPV (53%), Meniere's disease (10.1%) and recurrent vestibulopathy (8.1%), while the underlying diseases found were diabetes mellitus (11.4%), hypertension (32.2%) and dyslipidemia (34.2%). In Otoneurology Clinic, Thammasat Hospital, the peripheral vestibular disorders was the main etiology of vertigo, while the three most common causes were BPPV Meniere's disease, and recurrent vestibulopathy respectively.</td>

Case series with chart review of patients presenting positional vertigo and positional downbeating nystagmus during a 2-year period. Outpatients' tertiary referral center for balance disorders. Eighteen patients suffering from positional vertigo and presenting positional downbeating nystagmus were treated with a maneuver based on a modification of the procedure proposed by Crevits. disappearance of positional downbeating nystagmus. Positional downbeating nystagmus was elicited unilaterally with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver in 6 cases. In 4 patients, it was triggered by both left and right Dix-Hallpike tests. In 8 patients, the positional nystagmus was elicited by a straight head-hanging maneuver. The positional nystagmus was purely downbeating in 12 patients. In the remaining, a torsional component was detected. After the treatment, only 1 patient showed positional nystagmus at 30 days. In anterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the presence of a positional downbeating nystagmus in response to positional tests is key for diagnosis. In a significant number of patients, the affected side may not be detected because of the inconstant presence of a torsional component. Treatment with a simplified maneuver based on Crevits's technique can be considered an effective method for the treatment of anterior canal lithiasis, especially when the affected side cannot be detected clearly.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study is to compare the results obtained using 2 methods of treatment for horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV): the barbecue maneuver + forced prolonged position (FPP) versus the Gufoni maneuver. In a randomized prospective clinical trial, we recruited 147 patients affected by HSC-BPPV. The primary outcome was the absence of vertigo and nystagmus upon application of the supine roll test during the follow-up examination. A statistical evaluation was performed in order to assess whether any parameters (e.g. age, duration of nystagmus and symptoms) could influence in any way the results obtained with the 2 methods of treatment. One hundred and three of the 147 patients affected by HSC-BPPV had the geotropic form and 44 had the apogeotropic type. We were able to transform 29 cases of HSC-BPPV from apogeotropic to geotropic. Finally, we obtained a group of 112 patients who were randomized either to the barbecue + FPP procedure (54 patients) or to the Gufoni maneuver (58 patients). The most evident result is the higher percentage of success (statistically significant) with the Gufoni maneuver at the first session of treatment (86 vs. 61%). The final control showed that 44 out of 54 (81%) patients treated with the barbecue maneuver + FPP were symptom free compared to 54 out of 58 (93%) treated with the Gufoni maneuver. Both the barbecue maneuver + FPP and the Gufoni maneuver are valid methods for treating HSC-BPPV (geotropic forms). However, our results also indicate that the Gufoni maneuver has a significant advantage: the success rate shown at the follow-up, although without statistical significance, is undoubtedly higher (93 vs. 81%). This result, together with the fact that it is very easy to perform and that patient compliance is better, make the Gufoni maneuver the method of choice in HSC-BPPV treatment.</td>

	<td>The presentation of acute vertigo may represent both a common benign disorder or a life threatening but rare one. Familiarity with the common peripheral vestibular disorders will allow the clinician to rapidly "rule-in" a benign disorder and recognize when further testing is required. Key features of vertigo required to make an accurate diagnosis are duration, chronicity, associated symptoms, and triggers. Bedside tests that are critical to the diagnosis of acute vertigo include the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and canalith repositioning manuever, occlusive ophthalmoscopy, and the head impulse test. The goal of this review is to provide the clinician with the clinical and pathophysiologic background of the most common disorders that present with vertigo to develop a logical differential diagnosis and management plan. </td>

The abnormal difference between ABR I and V latency was selected as parameters. The abnormal rate of high stimulation ABR was 56.4% in patients with recurrent episodes of vertigo many times (2 and above), of which the highest rate was 71.9% in MV patients, and the second one was BPPV. The abnormal rate of high stimulation ABR was 14.9% in patients during medication or intermittent episodes. The abnormal rate in all groups decreased obviously as compared to attack episodes. Abnormal rate of high stimulus rate ABR correlates well with recurrent vertigo significantly. The inner ear microcirculation may result in the attack of recurrent vertigo.</td>

They walked straight ahead for 7.62 m, with eyes open or closed, to the beat of a metronome at 60 beats/min, 120 beats/min and 176 beats/min. When adjusted for age and sex, normals veered significantly less and walked significantly further before veering than the unilateral weakness group; all groups veered significantly less at 120 beats/min than the slower or faster cadences. Older patients walked slightly but significantly slower than younger patients at the faster speeds. Step length did not differ among diagnostic groups. These data confirm the involvement of vestibular function in path integration, suggest a differentiation by type of vestibular impairment, and suggest some differences by cadence.</td>

	<td>An important component of management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been the application of postural restrictions after use of a canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM) to prevent the return of otolithic debris into the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). This study was designed to explore the effectiveness of postural restrictions in patients with BPPV caused by otolithic debris in the PSC. Seventy-four adult patients with unilateral PSC BPPV were enrolled into this study. All patients were managed with a CRM--either the modified Epley maneuver or the Semont maneuver. The patients were divided randomly into 2 groups: group A, with postural restrictions, and group B, without postural restrictions. The statistical analysis was performed with X2 tests and t-tests. No patients in either group showed positional nystagmus in the posttreatment evaluation under infrared videonystagmoscopy. No patients had symptoms of vertigo after the therapy. The results of follow-up vestibular tests were normal in both groups. In our experience, postural restrictions do not enhance the beneficial effect of the CRMs. They do not seem to have any protective role and therefore should not be recommended as an adjunct to the treatment of PSC BPPV.</td>

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients who presented with vertigo spells and were managed at our tertiary care referral center. Patients with only idiopathic BPPV presenting with typical vertigo spells and positioning Ny characteristic of the disease were included in this study. To investigate the positioning Ny, we studied the patients in the sitting position, during the head shaking test, and during the Dix-Hallpike test and the McClure-Pagnini test (Ny provoked by rotation of the head in a supine patient). Ny responses in all patients were observed using infrared videoscopy. We managed 412 patients affected by BPPV. Of the 412 patients, 292 (70.87%) were diagnosed to be having posterior canal-BPPV and 110 (26.99%) patients had horizontal canal-BPPV (HC-BPPV). The remaining 10 patients (2.44%) were identified to have anterior canal-BPPV. Spontaneous Ny in sitting position was observed, by infrared videoscopy, only in the patients affected by HC-BPPV. Spontaneous Ny in BPPV can be observed with infrared videoscopy in patients affected by HC-BPPV. The origin of this Ny is most likely due to a natural inclination of horizontal semicircular canal with respect to the horizontal plane. This Ny stops after flexion of the head in neutral position, and for this reason, it should be considered as a seemingly spontaneous Ny. This Ny, in our experience, is observed in most HC-BPPV patients but does not indicate the need for a different management protocol or any different prognostic value of HC-BPPV.</td>

This was a retrospective study comprising patients referred to our center after whiplash injury. The patients were evaluated with neurotologic examination including bedside and instrumental tests. A Dizziness Handicap Inventory evaluating the symptoms of patients was submitted before and after treatment and was evaluated. The BPPV patients were separately evaluated from those with cervicogenic vertigo, and a comparison between our data about idiopathic BPPV was done. Eighteen patients of whiplash who had BPPV were evaluated. The mean age was 38.2 years. BPPV was the cause of vertigo in 33.9% of total whiplash patients. In 16 cases, the posterior semicircular canal was involved; the lateral semicircular canal was involved in 2 cases. The instrumental neurotologic assessment did not show any alteration of either vestibulospinal reflexes or dynamic ocular movements. Duration of symptoms before treatment ranged from 3 to 26 days. A total of 55.5% of patients had relief from their symptoms after first repositioning maneuver. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory score improved in all patients treated with repositioning maneuvers, but no difference emerged with idiopathic BPPV data. BPPV after whiplash injury could be unveiled with a simple bedside examination of peripheral vestibular system, and a treatment could be done in the same session. The diagnosis of posttraumatic BPPV is not different from the idiopathic form, but the treatment may require more maneuvers to achieve satisfactory results.</td>

Number of patients with AC, posterior canal (PC), horizontal canal (HC), and multiple-canal involvement in posttraumatic versus idiopathic BPPV. 85.1% of patients were classified as idiopathic BPPV, whereas 14.9% had a history of posttraumatic BPPV. The prevalence of AC BPPV was significantly higher in the posttraumatic group (27.3%) compared with that in the idiopathic group (3.2%; Fisher's exact test: p = 0.021). Multiple-canal (combined) BPPV was observed more frequently after head trauma (27.3%) compared with the idiopathic form of the disorder (1.6%; p = 0.009). In particular, the risk for combined AC/PC BPPV was greater in posttraumatic than idiopathic cases (odds ratio, 13.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-167.8). No significant differences were observed for the involvement of the PC and HC between the two groups. Two cases of combined AC/PC BPPV are presented with particular respect to the underlying trauma mechanism. Head trauma is a risk factor for AC and combined BPPV, in particular AC/PC BPPV. Involvement of the AC should especially be considered in patients who experienced head trauma resulting in a nonupright position of the body.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can be treated using a simple repositioning maneuver. This study demonstrates the effects of early repositioning therapy in patients with BPPV, especially with regard to recurrence. We enrolled 138 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with BPPV in the emergency rooms and ENT out-patient clinics of Chung-Ang University Hospital and Samyook Medical Center from January to June 2009. All patients immediately underwent appropriate canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs) depending on canalith type and location. The CRPs were performed daily until the patient's symptoms were resolved. The patients were classified into two groups according to the duration between symptom onset and initial treatment: less than 24 hours (early repositioning group, n=66) and greater 24 hours (delayed repositioning group, n=72). We prospectively compared the numbers of treatments received and the recurrence rates between the two groups. Follow-up periods ranged from 8 to 14 months, 77 cases involved posterior canal BPPV, 48 cases were lateral canal BPPV (of which 20 cases were cupulolithiasis), and 13 cases were multiple canal BPPV. BPPV recurrence was found in a total of 46 patients (33.3%). The necessary numbers of CRPs were 2.3 for the early repositioning group and 2.5 for the late repositioning group, a difference that was not statistically significant (P=0.582). The early repositioning group showed a recurrence rate of 19.7%, and the delayed repositioning group showed a recurrence rate of 45.8% (P=0.002). Performing repositioning treatments as soon as possible after symptom onset may be an important factor in the prevention of BPVV recurrence.</td>

	<td>In recent years, there has been increasing pressure to measure and report quality in health care. However, there has been little focus on quality measurement in the field of neurology for conditions other than stroke and transient ischemic attack. As the number of evidence-based treatments for neurological conditions grows, so will the demand to measure the quality of care delivered. The purpose of this study was to review essential components of hospital performance measures for neurological disease and propose potential quality indicators for commonly encountered inpatient neurological diagnoses. We determined the most common inpatient neurological diagnoses at a major tertiary care medical center by reviewing the billing database. We then searched PubMed and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse to identify treatment guidelines for these conditions. Guideline recommendations with class I/level A evidence were evaluated as possible quality indicators. We found 94 guidelines for 14 inpatient neurological conditions other than stroke and transient ischemic attack. Of these, 36 guidelines contained at least 1 recommendation with class I evidence. Based on these, potential quality indicators for intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumococcal meningitis, coma following cardiac arrest, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are proposed. There are several inpatient neurological conditions with treatments or diagnostic test routines supported by high levels of evidence that could be used in the future as quality indicators.</td>

	<td>To investigate the following: 1) associations between vestibular symptoms and migraine in a well-characterized cohort of tertiary neurotology patients, 2) effects of comorbidity on clinical presentations, and 3) validity of proposed definitions of definite (dVM) and probable vestibular migraine (pVM). Retrospective chart review. Tertiary neurotology center. All 228 subjects with headache were selected from a larger investigation of 410 patients with vestibular symptoms who underwent comprehensive medical, surgical, and behavioral neurotologic consultations. Subjects had at least one of 4 diagnoses: dVM/pVM, Ménière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or chronic subjective dizziness. Subjects were divided into migraine (n = 164) and nonmigraine headache (n = 64) groups by International Headache Society criteria, then subdivided by those with vestibular symptoms related or unrelated to headache. Subjects meeting proposed criteria for dVM (n = 46) and pVM (n = 42) were identified. Statistical analyses investigated discriminating features and cohesiveness in each group, with or without comorbidity. Characteristics of dVM and pVM. Migraine, particularly migraine with aura, was more often related to vestibular symptoms than nonmigrainous headache. dVM and pVM groups did not differ in demographics, clinical histories, examinations, or vestibular testing. Numerous differences existed between dVM/pVM subjects with and without comorbid Ménière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or chronic subjective dizziness. The pVM group contained 4 subtypes. These results support an association between vestibular symptoms and migraine but not proposed distinctions between dVM and pVM. pVM does not appear to be a coherent diagnostic entity. Comorbid conditions are important causes of vestibular symptoms in patients with migraine.</td>

	<td>The study analyses the behavior of subjective visual vertical (SVV) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) before and after treatment, and offers a clinical-pathogenic interpretation. We studied 30 consecutive patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal treated with the Epley repositioning maneuver. SVV was determined at three different stages: at the time of diagnosis (1st test), after the repositioning maneuver (2nd test), and then 7 days after the resolution of the clinical picture (3rd test). The main study parameter was represented by the mean of 6 consecutive measurements (SVV(0)) for each patient. SVV was also examined in 20 healthy subjects, who represented the control group. The comparison between mean values and standard deviations showed a statistical significance of p<0.05. During the first test, the degree of deviation of SVV was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. Tilting towards the affected side was observed in all cases. The 2nd test showed an inversion in the orientation of SVV in 16 patients, and as a result of the Epley maneuver there was a statistically significant variation in SVV(0) values in 20 patients with respect to the previous test (2nd test vs. 1st test). This involved 87% (23 patients) of those who then had a negative Dix-Hallpike test, and none of the ones in whom paroxysmal positional nystagmus persisted. Lastly, no differences emerged in the behavior of the patient group vs. the control group during the third test. SVV is often altered during active BPPV. The degree of otolithic dysfunction is never high and, in all cases, it is brief in duration. Tilting towards the dysfunctional side is essentially a constant in untreated BPPV. This could be due to a substantial loss of otoconia, with a decrease in the density and specific weight of the macula, and thus hypofunction of the receptor. The observation of a significant variation in SVV after therapeutic maneuvers has a favorable predictive value, as it probably reflects the migration of otoliths to the utricle, where saturation mechanisms can often have irritative effects leading to the inversion of SVV.</td>

	<td>Idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis) is the second most common cause of peripheral vertigo after benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and accounts for 7% of the patients who present at outpatient clinics specialising in the treatment of dizziness. The exact aetiology of the condition is unknown and the effects of corticosteroids on the condition and its recovery are uncertain. To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the management of patients with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis). We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 28 December 2010. Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo, no treatment or other active treatments, for adults diagnosed with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction. Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data. Three authors independently assessed risk of bias. Four trials, involving a total of 149 participants, compared the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids against placebo. All the trials were small and of low methodological quality. Although there was an overall significant effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo medication on complete caloric recovery at one month (risk ratio (RR) of 2.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 6.00, P = 0.007), no significant effect was seen on complete caloric recovery at 12 months (RR 1.58; 95% CI 0.45 to 5.62, P = 0.48), or on the extent of caloric recovery at either one month (mean difference (MD) 9.60%; 95% CI -20.66 to 39.86, P = 0.53) or at 12 months (MD 6.83%; 95% CI -27.69 to 41.36, P = 0.70). In addition, there was no significant difference between corticosteroids and placebo medication in the symptomatic recovery of vestibular function following idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction with respect to vertigo at 24 hours (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.04 to 3.57, P = 0.40) and use of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score at one, three, six and 12 months. Overall, there is currently insufficient evidence from these trials to support the administration of corticosteroids to patients with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction. We found no trials with a low risk of methodological bias that used the highest level of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. We recommend that future studies should include health-related quality of life and symptom-based outcome measures, in addition to objective measures of vestibular improvement, such as caloric testing and electronystagmography.</td>

The cases were admitted to the Departments of Otolaryngology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery in the Faculty of Medicine, Kocatepe University, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey with the complaint of vertigo between January 2004 and December 2008. The right hemi cerebellum volumes of the subjects with BPPV and the controls were measured smaller than the left hemi cerebellar volumes, however, there was no statistically significant quantitative evidence detected in terms of cerebellar asymmetry between sagittal and axial plane estimates in the cases with vertigo. There was statistical significance between the right and left cerebellum in both the patient and control groups (p=0.023), however, the difference did not change according to gender. There were no statistically significant age and gender dependent cerebellar atrophy and asymmetry between BPPV and control subjects. There was no cerebellar atrophy and asymmetry between BPPV and age matched control groups. The stereological evaluation of hemi cerebellar symmetry and atrophy in humans is important for both clinicians and anatomists. The technique is simple, inexpensive, and reliable.</td>

SSC BPPV may be readily treated at the bedside, which is a key component in excluding central causes of down-beating nystagmus.

	<td>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2007.Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) can occur as a result of disease, trauma or postoperatively. The dysfunction is characterised by complaints of dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical manoeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation (VR). To assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in the adult, community-dwelling population of people with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The most recent search was 1 July 2010, following a previous search in March 2007. Randomised trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We sought comparisons of VR versus control (placebo etc.), other treatment (non-VR, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of VR. We considered the outcome measures of frequency and severity of dizziness or visual disturbance; changes in balance impairment, function or quality of life; and measure/s of physiological status with known functional correlation. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for risk of bias. We included 27 trials, involving 1668 participants, in the review. Trials addressed the effectiveness of VR against control/sham interventions, medical interventions or other forms of VR. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of VR over control or no intervention. The exception to this was when movement-based VR was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term. There were no reported adverse effects. There is moderate to strong evidence that VR is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that VR provides a resolution of symptoms and improvement in functioning in the medium term. However, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of VR.</td>

	<td>We encountered patients who had static direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN) canceled at about 20-30° yaw head rotation from the supine position. This nystagmus was also canceled when the head was rotated 180° from this position. We termed these head positions neutral points. The positional nystagmus observed (except at the neutral points) was thought to occur due to a "heavy cupula" or "light cupula". The purpose of this study was to examine DCPN with neutral points as well as the pathomechanism of this condition. Retrospective case review of patients attending two hospitals. Sixteen patients who exhibited DCPN with neutral points were examined using an infrared camera (installed in goggles). Using this system, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was recorded, and VOR gain was obtained. Vestibular function and the affected side were determined. In addition, the angle between the supine position and neutral point was measured in each patient. We also examined other positional nystagmus occurring at other times. In the heavy cupula type group, we noted positional nystagmus for which repositioning maneuvers were successful, whereas, in the light cupula type group, repositioning maneuvers were not effective. The angle between supine position and neutral point was 26.5 ± 11.6°. Heavy cupula type may occur as a result of otoconia while light cupula type may be due to the specific gravity of the endolymph. The VOR gain and side of the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) observed suggested that the affected side was that to which the neutral point was deviated.</td>

Various tests have been conducted in patients with migrainous vertigo; however, only a few studies have been reported on otolith function. The aim of the present study was to increase the understanding of migrainous vertigo pathophysiology by assessing the sacculocollic pathway in patients with migrainous vertigo using vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials testing (VEMPs). Prospective study. Tertiary referral center. VEMP testing was performed in 30 patients with migrainous vertigo and 31 healthy volunteers using 90- and 100-dB tone-pip stimuli. We compared hearing, p13 and n23 latency, VEMP asymmetry, and VEMP formation rate between the patient and control groups. No between-group difference was observed in p13 and n23 latency or VEMP asymmetry. The rate of normal VEMP wave formation in both ears was significantly lower in the patient group compared with that of the control group in response to the 90-dB stimulus. Furthermore, VEMP wave formation was absent in both ears at 100 dB in significantly more patients than in control subjects. The results indicate that patients with migrainous vertigo show abnormal VEMP findings, suggesting that migrainous vertigo might have a lesion at the sacculocollic pathway.</td>

	<td>BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It most often occurs spontaneously in the 50 to 70 year age group. In younger individuals it is the commonest cause of vertigo following head injury. There is a wide spectrum of severity from inconsistent positional vertigo to continuous vertigo provoked by any head movement. It is likely to be a cause of falls and other morbidity in the elderly. Misdiagnosis can result in unnecessary tests. The cardinal features and a diagnostic test were clarified in 1952 by Dix and Hallpike. Subsequently, it has been established that the symptoms are attributable to detached otoconia in any of the semicircular canals. BPPV symptoms can resolve spontaneously but can last for days, weeks, months, and years. Unusual patterns of nystagmus and nonrepsonse to treatment may suggest central pathology. Diagnostic strategies and the simplest "office" treatment techniques are described. Future directions for research are discussed.</td>

After the disappearance of positional nystagmus, patients were asked about the time of cessation of the positional vertigo. Thus, the primary outcomes were evaluated by the self-reported onset and remission of positional vertigo. The time course of remission of positional vertigo was then calculated. The average and median period from the onset to natural remission of positional vertigo in patients with AH-BPPV was 13 and 7 days, respectively. We have already reported that the average and median period from the onset to natural remission of positional vertigo in patients with GH-BPPV was 16 and 7 days, respectively (Imai et al., 2005 [8]).

Migraine is the most frequent vascular disorder that causes vertigo in all age groups. Vertigo may occur in up to 25% of patients with migraine. The lifetime prevalence of migrainous vertigo is almost 1%. Cerebrovascular disorders are estimated to account for 3% to 7% of patients with vertigo. Vestibular paroxysmia has been diagnosed in 1.8% to 4% of cases in various dizziness units. Vasculitic disorders are rare in the general population, but vertigo may be seen in almost up to 50% of patients with different vasculitic syndromes. migraine, cerebrovascular disorders especially involving the vertebrobasilar territory, cardiocirculatory diseases, neurovascular compression of the eighth nerve, and vasculitis are vascular causes of vertigo syndromes.</td>

	<td>We describe a rarely encountered case of coexisting bilateral multicanal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vestibular schwannoma in a 56-year-old woman. The patient had presented with a 10-year history of dizziness and imbalance, and her vestibular findings were perplexing. We decided on a working diagnosis of BPPV and began treatment. After several months of canalith repositioning maneuvers had failed to resolve her symptoms, we obtained magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed the presence of the vestibular schwannoma. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of differentiating between central and peripheral vestibular disorders, as well as central and anterior canal BPPV-induced down-beating nystagmus in order to establish the correct diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED), and emergency physicians (EPs) consider these presentations a priority for decision support. Assessing for nystagmus and defining its features are important steps for any acute dizziness decision algorithm. The authors sought to describe nystagmus documentation in routine ED care to determine if nystagmus assessments might be an important target in decision support efforts. Medical records from ED visits for dizziness were captured as part of a surveillance study embedded within an ongoing population-based cohort study. Visits with documentation of a nystagmus assessment were reviewed and coded for presence or absence of nystagmus, ability to draw a meaningful inference from the description, and coherence with the final EP diagnosis when a peripheral vestibular diagnosis was made. Of 1,091 visits for dizziness, 887 (81.3%) documented a nystagmus assessment. Nystagmus was present in 185 of 887 (20.9%) visits. When nystagmus was present, no further characteristics were recorded in 48 of the 185 visits (26%). The documentation of nystagmus (including all descriptors recorded) enabled a meaningful inference about the localization or cause in only 10 of the 185 (5.4%) visits. The nystagmus description conflicted with the EP diagnosis in 113 (80.7%) of the 140 visits that received a peripheral vestibular diagnosis. Nystagmus assessments are frequently documented in acute dizziness presentations, but details do not generally enable a meaningful inference. Recorded descriptions usually conflict with the diagnosis when a peripheral vestibular diagnosis is rendered. Nystagmus assessments might be an important target in developing decision support for dizziness presentations.</td>

	<td>CONCLUSION. The recurrence rate of vertigo due to any cause in patients with vestibular neuritis (VN) was about 26.0% in our study. No clinical characteristics were significantly associated with recurrences. We aimed to: 1) determine the prevalence of recurrent VN; 2) compare the clinical characteristics and epidemiologic factors of patients with non-recurrent and recurrent VN; and 3) determine the prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with VN. In 131 patients diagnosed as having VN (68 males, aged 49.8 ± 14.9 years and 63 females, aged 57.5 ± 12.5 years), a retrospective chart review and telephone survey about the recurrent vertigo were performed. Vestibular function testing, inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pure tone audiograms were performed on every patient. Vestibular function testing was repeated in patients with recurrences. Fourteen of 131 patients (10.7%) had recurrent VN. The subjective intensity of recurrent VN was less than the first attack. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics such as accompanying headache or preceding respiratory infection and in epidemiologic risk factors between patients with recurrent and non-recurrent VN. Twenty of 131 patients (15.3%) experienced BPPV during the follow-up period.</td>

	<td>Several repositioning maneuvers have been proposed for the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) due to canalithiasis of the horizontal semicircular canal (HSC). However, comparisons between these canalith repositioning procedures as well as a generally accepted algorithm for the management of HSC canalithiasis are currently lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of 3 different treatment proposals and review the relevant literature. Prospective clinical study. Tertiary neurotology department. Sixty patients diagnosed with HSC canalithiasis. A single application of Baloh's maneuver (n = 13), Vannucchi's forced prolonged position (n = 29), or Asprella-Gufoni maneuver (n = 18). Bilateral geotropic nystagmus. The first application of the Baloh's maneuver seemed to be significantly less effective than both Vannucchi's forced prolonged position (p = 0.035) and the Asprella-Gufoni maneuver (p = 0.006). No significant difference was detected in the efficiency of Vannucchi's forced prolonged position and the Asprella-Gufoni maneuver for this population (p = 0.4). The Asprella-Gufoni maneuver and Vannucchi's forced prolonged position both seem to be significantly more effective than the Baloh's maneuver in the treatment of HSC canalithiasis. The important pros of the Asprella-Gufoni maneuver versus Vannucchi's forced prolonged position are patient's convenience and maximal use of gravitational and angular acceleration forces. Controlled clinical studies are needed to conclude to an evidence-based proposal for the therapeutical steps that should be followed after the diagnosis of HSC canalithiasis.</td>

The aim of the study is to find possible alterations in Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) recordings in BPPV patients, because the saccule is part of the VEMP pathway. 27 BPPV patients (24 unilateral and 3 bilateral) aged 20 to 70 years and 30 healthy age matched controls. BPPV was diagnosed by the upbeating geotropic nystagmus found in the supine position with the head overextended towards one side. The subjects were investigated with pure tone audiometry, bi-thermal caloric test with electronystagmographic (ENG) recording, and VEMP recording. P1 latency and N1 latency did not present any statistical difference between control ears and affected ears of the BPPV population. The percentage of abnormal VEMP in the BPPV population was statistically higher than in the control ears (p < 0.005). No significant relationship could be shown between the occurrence of Canal Paresis and abnormal VEMP. No relationship was found between the side (right or left ear) where BPPV appeared clinically and the side where abnormal VEMP was registered. BPPV is a clinical entity associated with increased occurrence of abnormal VEMP recordings, possibly due to degeneration of the saccular macula, which is part of the neural VEMP pathway.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is characterized by recurrent attacks of dizziness in a healthy child. Complete recovery typically takes place during childhood, and an epidemiological link with migraine has been pointed out. Nevertheless, data concerning long-term patient outcome are scarce. We analyzed the clinical data of 17 patients diagnosed with BPV between 1991 and 2008 in our neuropediatric department; we particularly focused on family medical history and long-term patient outcome by reviewing their medical files and by interviewing the families with a standardized questionnaire administered by phone. Thirteen families responded to the questionnaire, performed 1.1 to 24.5 years after onset. Among 10 patients older than 11 years of age, five continue to suffer attacks of vertigo. Median age at recovery was six years. Nine subjects exhibited migraine, including all six aged 15 years or older. There was a first-degree history of migraine in eight out of 13 children. BPV may not be a homogeneous condition, as some children have a poorer prognosis than others. The strong link with migraine, already noticed by previous authors, led us to discuss the pathophysiology of this condition.</td>

CHAMP and extratympanic ECoG were performed in all patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and definitions of abnormal values were less than 0.3 ms in latency delay (0.5 kHz high pass noise [HPN]-click alone) and less than 0.95 in compound amplitude ratio (click alone-0.5 kHz HPN/click alone) in CHAMP and 0.4 for the summating potential/action potential ratio in ECoG. The mean latency delay and amplitude ratio of CHAMP in the MD group significantly differed from these values for other groups, whereas the mean summating potential/action potential ratio of ECoG did not. In ECoG, sensitivity was as low as 21%, specificity was 97%, and diagnostic accuracy was 62%. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of CHAMP were 64%, 98%, and 80%, respectively, in latency delay and 91%, 83%, and 88%, respectively, in amplitude ratio. The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of CHAMP were significantly higher than the corresponding values for ECoG. CHAMP is more valuable in detection of definite MD than extratympanic ECoG.</td>

Cross-sectional analysis of a national database. All outpatient clinic visits for patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving one of six common otologic diagnoses from 2005 to 2007 in the United States were determined from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The distribution of the visits for these diagnoses across 15 specialties was assessed. The number of visits was projected to the 2020 population based on changes in population demographics predicted by the US Census Bureau. An estimated 4.48 ± 0.49 million clinic visits with an otologic issue as a coded diagnosis were conducted in 2005 to 2007 in patients aged ≥ 65 years. These consisted of 230,000 visits for benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, 263,000 visits for vestibular neuritis, 292,000 visits for Meniere's disease, 1.09 million visits for tinnitus, and 2.85 million visits for sensorineural hearing loss. Otolaryngology, internal medicine, family practice, and neurology managed the most visits, seeing 57.0%, 21.0%, 14.3%, and 2.2% of the cases, respectively. With expected changes in population demographics by 2020, annual clinic visits for an otologic diagnosis will increase from 1.49 ± 0.78 million to 2.14 million visits in the elderly, annualized, including 1.218 million visits to otolaryngology. These data quantify the current outpatient otology workload and predict a substantial increase for many specialties, including otolaryngology.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), of the horizontal canal, in the apogeotropic form (AHBPPV) was described in 1995. Based on 30 observations of typical AHBPPVs of the horizontal canal, we endeavor to discuss the relevance of physiotherapy. Material and Method. Thirty observations of typical apogeotropic BPPVs of the horizontal canal treated with a 360° barbeque rotation on the BPPV side, reviewed in consultation at 1 and 3 weeks and reevaluated the following year. Results. Our cohort of 30 patients had an average age of 58.6 years. The apogeotropic BPPVs of the horizontal canal, which can be transformed into BPPVs of the posterior canal or into geotropic-type BPPVs of the horizontal canal do not recover more quickly. Patients who follow the positional advice do not recover more quickly than those who do not (P = 0.152). The 15 patients treated on average 13.73 days after the onset of the disease did not recover more quickly after the start of therapeutic treatment than those treated later (P = 0.032). Conclusion. Here, we demonstrate that the direction of rotation during the maneuvers is of no importance for the results. We show that transformability is not a guarantee of rapid recovery and that the therapist's effectiveness is limited when it comes to the short-term results.</td>

	<td>Patient medical history is important for making a diagnosis of causes of dizziness, but there have been no studies on the diagnostic value of individual items in the history. This study was performed to identify and validate useful questions for suspecting a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Construction and validation of a disease prediction model was performed at the outpatient clinic in the Department of General Medicine of Chiba University Hospital. Patients with dizziness were enrolled (145 patients for construction of the disease prediction model and 61 patients for its validation). This study targeted BPPV of the posterior semicircular canals only with a positive Dix-Hallpike test (DHT + BPPV) to avoid diagnostic ambiguity. Binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the items that were useful for diagnosis or exclusion of DHT + BPPV. Twelve patients from the derivation set and six patients from the validation set had DHT + BPPV. Binomial logistic regression analysis selected a "duration of dizziness ≤15 seconds" and "onset when turning over in bed" as independent predictors of DHT + BPPV with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 4.36 (1.18-16.19) and 10.17 (2.49-41.63), respectively. Affirmative answers to both questions yielded a likelihood ratio of 6.81 (5.11-9.10) for diagnosis of DHT + BPPV, while negative answers to both had a likelihood ratio of 0.19 (0.08-0.47). A "duration of dizziness ≤15 seconds" and "onset when turning over in bed" were the two most important questions among various historical features of BPPV.</td>

Mechanical factors might play a role in the onset of the idiopathic form of BPPV. We performed a structured questionnaire study of physical activity in patients with BPPV and controls. Sixty-three consecutive patients with idiopathic BPPV participated in the study. Their mean age was 59.2 ± 14.5 years; 14 were men and 49 were women. Sixty-four age- and sex-matched generally healthy individuals served as controls. Levels of physical activity were assessed by the PASE questionnaire, which consists of 12 items quantifying physical activity during leisure, household, and occupational activities over a 7-day period. The total physical score activity was significantly lower in BPPV patients than in controls. Differences were found mainly in household and leisure activity, while occupational activity was similar in both groups, regardless of gender. Patients older than 60 years had significantly lower PASE scores than controls, whereas patients aged 60 years or younger reported similar physical activity to controls. No differences were found between physical activity scores in different types of BPPV or in patients with a first versus recurrent attack of vertigo.</td>

A total of 44.3% of cases had orthostatism or syncope, 15.7% with instability (possibly due to bilateral vestibular hypofunction), 14.2% with MARV and 8.6% with BPPV. The presence of BPPV was observed in older patients (40 years), whilst MARV was a condition seen in younger ones (35 years). These findings are of interest and remind us that benign paroxysmal vertigo is a childhood condition and age is a risk for BPPV. Migraine patients often present with neuro-otological symptoms that can be classified as inter-episodic and episodic symptoms, and specific and non-specific migraine symptoms. This approach is of obvious pathophysiological interest, given that MARV and the possible vestibular hypofunction of migraine patients are symptoms that share physiological aspects with migraine, while the orthostatism symptoms and BPPV are non-specific and are seen to be associated with other conditions.</td>

	<td>A 69-year-old woman, with no history of vertigo attacks, presented with the classical triad of symptoms for Ménière's disease in the right ear (vertigo, tinnitus, fullness). Upon admission, the patient had a third-degree horizontal nystagmus beating to the right, after beating towards the left ear a few hours earlier. Audiometry confirmed a severe sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear, especially at low and high frequencies. The following day, the patient complained of short episodes of vertigo linked to head movement, and the Hallpike test was compatible with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the right ear. To our knowledge this is the first description of BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal manifesting during the first vertiginous attack of Ménière's disease in the same ear. It was possible that the hydropic distension or rupture damaged the otolithic apparatus, leading to the release of otoconia debris which migrated to the posterior semicircular canal where it resulted in BPPV.</td>

	<td>The benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the horizontal semicircular canal is manifested with either geotropic or apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus. A 61-year-old male patient who experienced repeated episodes of positional vertigo is presented in this study. The vertigo was reported to be more severe while rotating his head to the left and then to the right. The initial examination revealed a geotropic purely horizontal nystagmus at the lateral positions of the head compatible with canalolithiasis of the left horizontal semicircular canal. In this case, the otoconia debris migrates from the vestibule into the horizontal semicircular canal through its nonampullary end, where they float freely (canalolithiasis). Five days later, the geotropic nystagmus transformed to apogeotropic. Thus, it may be assumed that the otoconia debris adhered to the cupula and converted the canalolithiasis to cupulolithiasis of the horizontal semicircular canal on the same side. With rotation of the head to the left while the patient was in the supine position, gravity causes the weighted cupula to deflect ampullofugally, resulting in apogeotropic nystagmus; the opposite was noticed when the head was rotated to the right. The so-called barbecue maneuver was initially effective curing the geotropic form of the condition and consequently the modified Semont maneuver for the apogeotropic form.</td>

	<td>Migraine in childhood and adolescence has been associated with the presence of behavioural and emotional difficulties, but only few data are available with respect to unusual types of headache syndromes such as Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood (BPVC). Aim of the present study was to evaluate the behavioural and emotional profiles of clinically referred children and adolescents suffering from BPVC and migraine, as compared to normal controls. According to the revised International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) the BPVC belongs to the category of "primary headache", as a migraine equivalent, in a subset that is called "periodic syndromes of childhood". A total of 60 clinically referred children and adolescents (4-15 years) 21 suffering from BPVC and 20 from migraine, according to the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD-2, and 19 normal control (NC) were recruited in this study. Psychological assessment were performed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). Although most of the patients suffering from headache had scores within the normative non-pathological range, both BPVC and migraine patients had significantly higher CBCL total, internalizing, and externalizing scores, as compared to NC. Furthermore, both BPVC and migraine groups displayed significantly higher CDI and MASC scores than NC group. No differences were found between the two types of headache. In conclusion, clinically referred children and adolescents with BPVC and migraine showed higher indices of behavioural and emotional symptoms, both internalizing and externalizing, as compared to normal peers.</td>

	<td>Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often require multiple appointments for treatment with Epley manoeuvres. Waiting times for medical follow up can be very long. To reduce waiting times and increase availability of ENT outpatients' appointments, a nurse-led dizziness clinic (NLDC) to follow up BPPV patients was established. Prospective audit of 99 consecutive patients attending the NLDC, at which patients are assessed and treated, was conducted. Non-responders are redirected for further medical review. 99 patients were seen in 200 appointments in the NLDC from July 2007 to May 2009. The mean time to NLDC was 16 days. 67 patients were discharged from the NLDC free of symptoms. Cost analysis revealed savings of £3,800. A survey of NLDC attendees revealed that the care they received was rated as excellent, very good or good by 92% of patients. In conclusion, the NLDC is an innovation which increases availability of ENT outpatient appointments. This is acceptable to patients and is a natural extension of the roles of ENT nurse practitioners which could be implemented in other ENT departments.</td>

	<td>Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) represents at least 35% of vertigo cases and perhaps much more. The aim of this study was to review a proposed new type of BPPV which may be detected by using a mechanical assistance in BPPV diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers. MATERIELS AND METHODS: The prospective study extracted subjects from 465 patients who presented with some positional vertigo or unsteadiness. Only 152 dizzy patients, who presented with positional nystagmus but no true vertigo, were included. The TRV armchair permits rotation of patients wearing infrared video goggles in all semi-circular planes. Treatment effectiveness was defined as absence of symptoms or findings 3 days after the therapy sessions. If not initially successful, repeat therapeutic sessions were performed or patients underwent further vestibular examination and sometime MRI. One hundred nine of the 152 patients demonstrated a low level canalithiasis showing nystagmus. Unusual data were collected: Ninety seven had a lateral canal and 12 had posterior canal conditions. The average of the patients was 62 and they had an average of 1.6 mechanical therapeutic maneuvres to reach the success end-point. Some patients have persistent unsteadiness or drunkenness sensations after being treated by conventional maneuvers for BPPV. Often considered a post-BPPV otolithic syndrome an alternative possibility is BPPV with a very few otoliths in the lateral canal. The therapeutic technique using the mechanical chair permits to improved diagnosis of canalithiasis, especially that involving the horizontal canals. Some mild dizziness, which may be disabling and chronic can be better investigated and treated with mechanical assistance.</td>

	<td>Background. This study is a review of the incidence, clinical characteristics, and management of secondary BPPV. The different subtypes of secondary BPPV are compared to each other, as well as idiopathic BPPV. Furthermore, the study highlights the coexistence of BPPV with other inner ear pathologies. Methods. A comprehensive search for articles including in the abstract information on incidence, clinical characteristics, and management of secondary BPPV was conducted within the PubMed library. Results. Different referral patterns, different diagnostic criteria used for inner ear diseases, and different patient populations have led to greatly variable incidence results. The differences regarding clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes may support the hypothesis that idiopathic BPPV and the various subtypes of secondary BPPV do not share the exact same pathophysiological mechanisms. Conclusions. Secondary BPPV is often under-diagnosed, because dizziness may be atypical and attributed to the primary inner ear pathology. Reversely, a limited number of BPPV patients may not be subjected to a full examination and characterized as idiopathic, while other inner ear diseases are underdiagnosed. A higher suspicion index for the coexistence of BPPV with other inner ear pathologies, may lead to a more integrated diagnosis and consequently to a more efficient treatment of these patients.</td>

	<td>Locomotion is impaired in some people with vestibular disorders. Performance on cognitive tasks is also impaired in many people with vestibular disorders. The goal of this study was to determine if patients with vestibular disorders have decreased ability to complete a dual task performance involving a cognitive task, an additional motor task or both tasks, combined along a linear path. Subjects were normal, had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or had various vestibular disorders that caused unilateral weakness. They were asked to walk 7.62 m in a straight line with eyes open or closed, without extra tasks, and while nodding the head, naming things, and both nodding and naming. The patients walked significantly slower than controls, especially when performing the cognitive task. Patients had greater ataxia and began veering sooner than normals. The subjects' veering increased significantly with the addition of cognitive tasks. The patient groups did not differ significantly from each other. The changes in velocity did not affect the veering. These data suggest that patients with vestibular disorders are impaired in their ability to complete a linear path when cognitive tasks are added.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is among the most frequent neurological chief complaints in emergency room (ER) patients. Although the majority of underlying disorders are benign, serious causes that require immediate in-hospital treatment may occur that are difficult to identify clinically. Retrospective study of 475 consecutive ER neurological consultations with dizziness as the chief complaint. Of all ER dizziness patients, 73% were initially assigned to benign and 27% to serious diagnoses. The two most frequent disorders were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (22%) and stroke (20%). On follow-up (available in 124 patients), 43% of all ER diagnoses were corrected: 6% of benign ER diagnoses were corrected to serious diagnoses, 23% of serious ER diagnoses were revised to benign. The most frequent corrections concerned patients with an ER diagnosis of stroke or vestibular neuronitis. In the patient sample studied here, serious causes of dizziness were more prevalent than can be expected from population-based surveys or data from specialized outpatient departments. However, inappropriate assignment of dizziness patients to benign diagnoses still occurred in a relevant proportion of patients. ER clinical pathways, planning of imaging resources and follow-up of patients in- and outside the hospital must take these points into consideration.</td>

	<td>To compare mallet osteotomes with screwable osteotomes determining benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) following the osteotome closed sinus floor elevation procedure. This triple-blind randomized controlled trial involved 196 patients affected by edentulous atrophic ridges (107 males and 89 females; mean age 62.05±7.10; age range 49-79 years), requiring an osteotome closed sinus floor elevation procedure. Patients were randomly allocated to either a mallet-osteotomes group (Group 1, n=98) or a screwable osteotomes group (Group 2, n=98). Two different surgeons, blind to the study, performed the closed sinus lift procedure according to the blocks allocation. A complete post-surgical examination, including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, was performed on 196 patients before and after surgery. The diagnosis of BPPV was supported by the existence of ageotropic nystagmus concurrent with vertigo. Three patients of Group 1 (3/98-3.06%) showed a BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal omo-lateral to the implanted side 1 or 2 days after the surgical procedure, which was promptly solved using the Epley re-positioning maneuver. Preparation of implant beds with osteotome and mallet transmits percussive and vibratory forces capable of detaching the otoliths from their normal location; moreover, the patient's surgical head position favors the displacement of otoliths into the posterior semicircular canal. Implant surgeons should be aware of this possible complication following closed sinus lift procedure and patients should always be informed before undergoing surgery.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common complaint of older patients in primary care, yet not much is known about the course of incident dizziness. The aim of the study was to follow-up symptoms, subjective impairments and needs of older patients (≥65) with incident dizziness and to determine predictors of chronic dizziness. Furthermore, we analysed general practitioners' (GPs') initial diagnoses, referrals and revised diagnoses after six months. An observational study was performed in 21 primary care practices in Germany, including a four-week and six-month follow-up. A questionnaire comprising characteristic matters of dizziness and a series of validated instruments was completed by 66 participants during enrollment and follow-up (after 1 month and 6 months). After six months, chart reviews and face-to-face interviews were also performed with the GPs. Mean scores of dizziness handicap, depression and quality of life were not or only slightly affected, and did not deteriorate during follow-up; however, 24 patients (34.8%) showed a moderate or severe dizziness handicap, and 43 (62.3%) showed a certain disability in terms of quality of life at the time of enrollment. In multivariate analysis, n = 44 patients suffering from chronic dizziness (dependent variable, i.e. relapsing or persistent at six months) initially had a greater dizziness handicap (OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.05-1.47) than patients with transient dizziness. GPs referred 47.8% of the patients to specialists who detected two additional cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). New-onset dizziness relapsed or persisted in a considerable number of patients within six months. This was difficult to predict due to the patients' heterogeneous complaints and characteristics. Symptom persistence does not seem to be associated with deterioration of the psychological status in older primary care patients. Management strategies should routinely consider BPPV as differential diagnosis.</td>

Orthotropic nystagmus was present in 67% of the cases and absent in 33%; when we found orthotropic nystagmus, the maneuver was effective in 81% of the patients, but only in 57% if this nystagmus was not present (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.004; odds ratio, 3.308; 95% confidence interval, 1.492-7.334). The maneuver's efficacy and the presence of orthotropic nystagmus were not affected by the duration of nystagmus status in the Dix-Hallpike test. The duration of the latency period had no effect on the maneuver's efficacy, but it did affect the appearance of orthotropic nystagmus (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.016). The presence of orthotropic nystagmus in the second position of the Semont maneuver indicates a good prognosis, but its absence does not necessarily mean that the maneuver will fail. Orthotropic nystagmus is more common in patients with shorter latency periods, suggesting that its appearance is related to cupulolithiasis mechanisms.</td>

	<td>Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in migraine as a cause of vestibular symptoms. Starting with 1970s case reports linking migraine to childhood vertigo, neurotologists worldwide have increasingly diagnosed migraine. Various syndromes of vestibular migraine (VM) have been described, diagnostic criteria proposed, epidemiologic data collected, and neurophysiologic models developed. Yet, the concept that migraine causes vestibular symptoms rests on a surprisingly thin research database. Current concepts of VM are based on expert opinion, not empirical data. No general consensus exists about the definition of VM. No studies have analyzed its essential features. Just one well-controlled medication trial has been published. No biomarkers are known. To stimulate more rigorous research, this paper poses three questions about clinical investigations into migraine and vestibular symptoms: What variables should be measured? What patients should be studied? How might clinical trials yield both clinically useful results and greater insights into pathophysiologic processes? Using these questions, the limits of current knowledge are explored. Applicable research methods from epidemiology to genetics are examined. Pilot data demonstrating pharmacologic and genetic dissection techniques are presented. Ambitious, but practical, near-term clinical research goals are enumerated, including rigorous validation of diagnostic criteria and development of empirically derived management guidelines.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most frequent cause of recurrent vertigo and according to the canalo- and cupulolithiasis theory it is caused by detached otoconia which accumulate in the semicircular canals. However, the mechanisms leading to detachment of otoconia from the matrix are still poorly understood. Head trauma, inner ear diseases, advanced age, migraine and bed rest are known predisposing factors. We report a case of a healthy 44-year-old female, who developed left sided benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 10 hours following standard bilateral diagnostic transcranial magnetic stimulation. As our patient did not innate any established predisposing factor and has a relatively young age, we conclude that diagnostic transcranial magnetic stimulation to elicit motor evoked potentials might be an iatrogenic cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>We report a prospective, randomised study of 51 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo treated with Epley's manoeuvre alone or Epley's manoeuvre plus labyrinthine sedative, at Sundaram Medical Foundation, Chennai, India. To compare the efficacy of Epley's manoeuvre versus Epley's manoeuvre plus labyrinthine sedative in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Consecutive patients were selected based on history and positive Dix-Hallpike test. Patients were randomised to receive either Epley's manoeuvre alone or Epley's manoeuvre plus labyrinthine sedative for one week. Both groups were followed up for four weeks. Univariate analysis showed that one- and four-week outcomes were influenced by the number of episodes, symptom duration and treatment type. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the one-week outcome was significantly influenced by symptom duration and treatment type, while the four-week outcome was significantly influenced by symptom duration alone. Patients receiving Epley's manoeuvre alone showed better recovery than those receiving both Epley's manoeuvre and labyrinthine sedative. Labyrinthine sedatives do not aid recovery from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo when used in addition to Epley's manoeuvre.</td>

	<td>Buffeting in a jerky ride in a bus or ambulance normally provokes a sustained tachypnoea driven by vibration and sensory mechanisms including vestibular signals. Tachypnoea reinforces the torso against mechanical shocks but results in overbreathing, causing a mild fall in CO(2). However, normal CO(2) is rapidly restored by a reduction in depth of breathing. We test the hypothesis that vulnerable subjects, exemplified by elderly individuals and patients with vestibular disorders, may fail to adapt to buffeting. Respiratory and cardiovascular functions were recorded from five elderly subjects, two patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function and five patients with 'BPPV,' while being exposed to 15-min buffeting in a flight simulator which simulated transport in an ambulance over rough pavement. Results were compared with published norms. Some subjects sustained overbreathing during motion, through either tachypnoea or deep breathing, causing a marked reduction in CO(2) levels (3/5, 2/2 avestibular, 4/5 elderly, 4/5 BPPV). Others failed to raise breathing frequency which would render them susceptible to mechanical shock (4/5 elderly, 1/2 avestibular). Overbreathing was particularly evident in three anxious subjects. Overbreathing during buffeting could be caused by (1) resetting of CO(2) rest levels lower; (2) change in receptor sensitivity; (3) adjustment of central drive to breathing; and (4) stiffening of posture because of motion discomfort reduced the ability to modulate breathing. The buffeting experienced was moderately violent. More profound hypocapnia and mechanical shock are likely to result in vulnerable individuals failing to adapt to severe buffeting in transport on unpaved roads, in war zones or by sea ambulance.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder. The recent development of diagnostic tools allowed clarification of its pathology. Dislodgement of the utricular otoconia is the basis of BPPV which leads to development of canalolithiasis or cupulolithiasis. Positional nystagmus test is a most essential bed side test. BPPV may involve multiple canals and utricle, thus showing complicated nystagmus pattern. Understanding the physiology of semicircular canals and vestibuloocular reflex allows proper diagnosis of a lesion side and types of BPPV. Based upon the basic and clinical findings, a lesion-specific physical therapy had been developed which turned out to be very effective. Nystagmus pattern can also be an index of the treatment outcome.</td>

	<td>Even after successful repositioning maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), some patients report dizziness lasting for a certain period afterwards. We studied the prevalence and clinical factors associated with residual dizziness in a sample of elderly patients. Sixty outpatients over 65 years of age, affected by idiopathic BPPV were recruited; the exclusion criterion was a history of previous episodes of vertigo, including positional. The patients were asked to describe their self-perceived anxiety for vertigo on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and successively treated with appropriate maneuvers till resolution of nystagmus. Data concerning the demographic and clinical features of BPPV were collected. Patients were followed until complete resolution of subjective dizziness and imbalance without positional nystagmus. Data about residual dizziness were collected from the second day from resolution of BPPV. Clinical and demographic factors related to residual dizziness were analyzed. Twenty-two subjects (37%) reported residual dizziness. In these subjects, the mean duration of residual dizziness was 13.4 ± 7.5 days. No association was observed between residual dizziness and gender, involved canal and the number of repositioning maneuvers before resolution. On the other hand, age older than 72 years, symptom duration greater than 9 days and VAS scale for anxiety greater than 10/100 were associated with an increased risk of residual dizziness. The odds ratio were respectively 6.5 (age-residual dizziness, Confidence Interval 95%), 6.5 (duration of vertigo-residual dizziness, Confidence Interval 95%) and 15.5 (anxiety levels-residual dizziness, Confidence Interval 95%). Longer symptom duration before diagnosis was associated with higher anxiety levels. The results underline the necessity for an early and correct diagnosis of BPPV, especially in the elderly.</td>

	<td>Secondary somatoform dizziness and vertigo (SVD) is an underdiagnosed and handicapping psychosomatic disorder, leading to extensive utilization of health care and maladaptive coping. Few long-term follow-up studies have focused on the assessment of risk factors and little is known about protective factors. The aim of this 1-year follow-up study was to identify neurootological patients at risk for the development of secondary SVD with respect to individual psychopathological disposition, subjective well-being and resilient coping. In a prospective interdisciplinary study, we assessed mental disorders in n=59 patients with peripheral and central vestibular disorders (n=15 benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, n=15 vestibular neuritis, n=8 Menière's disease, n=24 vestibular migraine) at baseline (T0) and 1 year after admission (T1). Psychosomatic examinations included the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, the Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), and a psychometric test battery measuring resilience (RS), sense of coherence (SOC), and satisfaction with life (SWLS). Subjective well-being significantly predicted the development of secondary SVD: Patients with higher scores of RS, SOC, and SWLS at T0 were less likely to acquire secondary SVD at T1. Lifetime mental disorders correlated with a reduced subjective well-being at T0. Patients with mental comorbidity at T0 were generally more at risk for developing secondary SVD at T1. Patients' dispositional psychopathology and subjective well-being play a major predictive role for the long-term prognosis of dizziness and vertigo. To prevent secondary SVD, patients should be screened for risk and preventive factors, and offered psychotherapeutic treatment in case of insufficient coping capacity.</td>

	<td>Ménière's syndrome appears to be the final common pathway of the mechanisms the inner ear responds to almost any injury. Although the autoimmune disease seems to play a major role, exposure to intense noise can also be a trigger in the appearance and/or aggravation of the disease. The case of 41 years old musician with a history of ankylosing spondylitis, diagnosed with Ménière's syndrome 5 years ago, is presented. Recently the symptoms became more polymorphic, revealing the association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's syndrome and high frequency hearing loss in an autoimmune background. Besides general, neurological and ENT examination, the diagnostic workup comprised of tonal audiogram, brain stem auditory evoked potentials, computerized dynamic posturography and videonistagmography. The final diagnosis was acute noise trauma, Ménière's syndrome, left horizontal semicircular canal BPPV, bilateral sensorineural sudden aggravated hearing loss in high frequencies (above 9 kHz) and allegedly autoimmune inner ear disease. Treatment with an association of corticosteroids, vasodilators and vitamins combined with Vannucchi's maneuver were followed by a significant relief of the symptoms. Although no causal relationship was found between acoustic trauma and increased endolymphatic pressure, both literature data and the case presented show that intense and prolonged noise exposure may aggravate peripheral vestibular syndrome.</td>

	<td>THERE ARE TWO FORMS OF LATERAL SEMICIRCULAR CANAL BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO: geotropic and apogeotropic. When the pathophysiological mechanism of the apogeotropic form is that of canalolithiasis, we can observe a transformation from an apogeotropic nystagmus into a geotropic one. Usually, this phenomenon happens simultaneously on both sides, thus enabling us to observe a right-beating paroxysmal positional nystagmus when the patient lies on the right side and a left-beating paroxysmal positional nystagmus on the left side. We describe a case in which the transformation occurred gradually, so that, after three head rotations from side to side in supine position, there was a right nystagmus beating toward the ground (geotropic) with the patient on the right side and a right nystagmus beating away from the ground (apogeotropic) on the left side. However, after further rotations we observed the nystagmus transformation also on the left side, with a geotropic nystagmus on both sides. The phenomenon of gradual transformation could happen because initially only a part of the debris moved from the anterior to the posterior aspect of the canal during head rotations.</td>

	<td>Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is the most common cause of episodic vertigo. It results from activation of semicircular canal receptors by the movement of calcium carbonate particles (otoconia) which dislodge from the otolith membranes. During changes in head position, the otoconia either float freely within the semicircular canal duct (canalithiasis) or adhere to and move with the cupula of the canal (cupulolithiasis). BPV from canalithiasis evokes brief spells of vertigo lasting seconds and can be diagnosed at the bedside by provoking paroxysmal vertigo and nystagmus on tilting the head in the plane of the affected canal. The nystagmus has a unique rotational axis perpendicular to the affected canal. The Dix-Hallpike test is a simple means of confirming the diagnosis in patients presenting with episodic vertigo or imbalance. Audiovestibular tests are only indicated if a symptomatic primary underlying inner ear disease is suspected. In over 80% of patients, BPV can be treated successfully with a single bedside Epley (particle-repositioning) manoeuvre, which can be performed by any medical practitioner.</td>

The diagnosis of BPPV can be made based on the history and examination. Patients usually report episodes of spinning evoked by certain movements, such as lying back or getting out of bed, turning in bed, looking up, or straightening after bending over.

	<td>To explore the clinical characteristics and possible pathological mechanisms of vertigo due to enlarged vestibule with lateral semicircular canal dysplasia. A retrospective review was conducted for 5 cases of peripheral vertigo due to enlarged vestibule with lateral semicircular canal dysplasia. Their characteristics of medical history, precipitating factors, course of vertigo, auditory tests, vestibular tests and imaging examine results were analyzed. The clinical characteristics were as follows. (1) Specifics of medical history: 4 cases suffered delays in gross motor development and potential equilibrium dysfunctions. One case failed to recount an earlier medical history, but could maintain normal hearing and vestibular functions for a long time in adulthood. (2) Most cases could identify the precipitating factors of initial attacks, such as head-bumping, nose-blowing and constipation, etc. resulting in sudden rises of intracranial or abdominal pressures. (3) Paroxysmal vertigo and progressive hearing loss were mimicking Meniere disease or large vestibular aqueduct syndrome. But its course of vertigo was different from those of Meniere disease and large vestibular aqueduct syndrome with regards to hearing levels and audiograms. (4) Some cases had positional vertigo. But the results of Dix-Hallpike and Roll tests were different from benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV). (5) The inner ear imaging showed enlarged vestibule with lateral semicircular canal dysplasia. The enlarged vestibule with lateral semicircular canal dysplasia is a rare etiology of peripheral vertigo. The history of delays in gross motor development and potential equilibrium dysfunctions in childhood may offer important diagnostic clues. And audiological and vestibular tests, high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance may help to ascertain the diagnosis.</td>

To compare the normal and abnormal UW, posterior canal and lateral canal with abnormal UW values, unilateral or bilateral of abnormal UW values, consistency of abnormal UW side and BPPV side between BPPV patients with and without relevant diseases, there were no significant differences (Chi-square values were 0.000, 0.000, 0.306, 0.027, P>0.05). BPPV patients with relevant diseases are common, which mainly occurs in middle-aged or aged people and female. Otolith ecclesiis and dysfunction of semicircular canal may have the same etiological factors. Caloric tests may do help to analyze the BPPV etiological factors.</td>

	<td>A retrospective study to investigate the clinical epidemiological characteristics of vertigo was carried out on 187 patients with vertigo. A clinical history for each patient was recorded precisely about the attack, frequency, and development of vertigo, its duration, intensity, and the accompanied symptoms including the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, etc. All the patients were subjected to physical examination with special attention to neurologic systems and Dix-Hallpike maneuver, computed tomography/computed tomography-angiography (CT/CTA) and MRI scan were performed when necessary. Majority of the patients in this study suffered with posterior circulation ischemia (59.89%) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (16.04%). Other ailments that affected these patients included migraine, Meniere's disease (1.6%), sudden hearing loss (1.07%), vestibular neuronitis, multiple sclerosis, acute viral encephalitis, meningioma, neurosis, posttraumatic vertigo, acute myocardial infarction (0.53%), and neurosis (14.97%). It appeared that in comparison to younger patients the elderly population is likely to be more susceptible to vertigo. Vertigo attacks patients with various diseases, which pre-dispose the patients to this disease. Presentation of vertigo can be clinically diagnosed in most cases of patients suffering from posterior circulation ischemia.</td>

Retrospective chart review. Specialized dizziness and balance center at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 619 patients (aged 19-89 yr, of whom 60% are women and 40% are men) diagnosed with 1 of 23 types of dizziness or postural instability. All patients were administered a standard 163-item dizziness questionnaire (including 77 review of systems items). Predicted diagnoses from the questionnaire, as determined by binary and multinomial logistic regressions, are compared with an ultimate clinical diagnosis made by an expert neurotologist based on full interview, examination, and clinical tests. Significant question groupings exist for each of the main diagnoses. A subset of 47 questions under multinomial logistic regression gave high predictive accuracies for migraine (92%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (90%) and Ménière's disease (86%), and fair predictive power for vestibular neuritis (63%), contributing to an overall predictive accuracy of 84%. A smaller subset of 32 questions gave an overall predictive accuracy of 71%. The capability of historical data to accurately predict the ultimate diagnosis for dizziness emphasizes the importance of a structured questionnaire in the evaluation of such patients. Future developments include the formulation of a computer-based program to generate a differential diagnosis for the practitioner to consider.</td>

	<td>The increased visual dependence noted in some vestibular patients may be secondary to their vertigo. We examine whether a single, brief vertigo attack, such as in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), modifies visual dependency. Visual dependency was measured before and after the Hallpike manoeuvre with (a) the Rod and Frame and the Rod and Disc techniques whilst seated and (b) the postural sway induced by visual roll-motion stimulation. Three subject groups were studied: 20 patients with BPPV (history and positive Hallpike manoeuvre; PosH group), 20 control patients (history of BPPV but negative Hallpike manoeuvre; NegH group) and 20 normal controls. Our findings show that while both patient groups showed enhanced visual dependency, the PosH and the normal control group decreased visual dependency on repetition of the visual tasks after the Hallpike manoeuvre. NegH patients differed from PosH patients in that their high visual dependency did not diminish on repetition of the visual stimuli; they scored higher on the situational characteristic questionnaire ('visual vertigo' symptoms) and showed higher incidence of migraine. We conclude that long term vestibular symptoms increase visual dependence but a single BPPV attack does not increase it further. Repetitive visual motion stimulation induces adaptation in visual dependence in peripheral vestibular disorders such as BPPV. A positional form of vestibular migraine may underlie the symptoms of some patients with a history of BPPV but negative Hallpike manoeuvre. The finding that they have non adaptable increased visual dependency may explain visuo-vestibular symptoms in this group and, perhaps more widely, in patients with migraine.</td>

	<td>To report the outcome of posterior semicircular canal occlusion surgery for intractable benign positional vertigo, regarding vertigo cure rate and hearing and balance outcomes. Retrospective review of 53 patients presenting with benign positional vertigo, unresponsive to repositioning manoeuvres, who eventually underwent posterior canal occlusion, over a 20 year period. From 1991 to 2011, 5364 benign positional vertigo patients were treated in our balance disorders clinic; 53 of those who failed to respond to repositioning underwent posterior canal occlusion. All 53 were cured of their benign positional vertigo. Nine suffered some symptomatic permanent hearing loss (>20 dB at low and >25 dB at high frequencies). Ten patients suffered caloric vestibular function deterioration, with mild but permanent subjective imbalance in five; a further 10 patients with no post-operative caloric test changes also had some permanent imbalance. Benign positional vertigo later developed in the operated ear lateral canal in two patients and in the opposite ear posterior canal in eight patients. Two patients needed bilateral sequential posterior canal occlusion. Posterior canal occlusion is a highly effective treatment for intractable benign positional vertigo, with what is probably an acceptable risk to hearing and balance: five of six patients will have no hearing problem and nine of 10 no balance problem after surgery.</td>

Randomized prospective clinical trial. Tertiary referral center. Patients were included in this study if they complained of vertigo and had been diagnosed as having unilateral idiopathic PC-BPPV for at least 1 week before Dix-Hallpike maneuver (DHM), remained for 30 days in the randomly assigned treatment, and had at least 48 months' follow-up. Forty-one patients were treated with a single PRM and 40 patients by B-D exercise. Resolution of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus on the DHM. The probability of recurrence was also studied. At Day 7, DHM was negative in 80.5% of the PRM-treated patients and in 25% of those treated by B-D exercise (p < 0.001). At Month 1, the differences between both treatment groups remained statistically significant (92.7% in PRM versus 42.5% in the B-D exercise had a negative DHM; p < 0.001). The variable that influenced that DHM became negative was the PRM (RR = 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-9.2; p < 0.001). The number of recurrences in PRM and B-D exercise were 0.56 ± 0.8 and 0.48 ± 0.8, respectively (p = 0.48). The recurrence rate at 48 months was 35.5% (15/41) in B-D exercise and 36.6% (9/31) in the PRM group (p = 0.62). Although the time interval until the first recurrence was similar (p = 0.44), patients included in the PRM group showed a significantly longer time interval between the first and second recurrence (p = 0.04). PRM is more effective treatment and as safe as B-D exercise in the short term for unilateral and idiopathic PC-BPPV, and although it does not reduce the probability of recurrence in the 4-year follow-up period compared with B-D exercise, it may delay the second recurrence's onset in those patients who had already experienced a single recurrence. Our study supports the use of PRM as the treatment of choice in unilateral and idiopathic PC-BPPV, although exercise may be also considered as an alternative treatment in selected cases.</td>

	<td>Effective navigation requires the ability to keep track of one's location and maintain orientation during linear and angular displacements. Path integration is the process of updating the representation of body position by integrating internally-generated self-motion signals over  time (e.g., walking in the dark). One major source of input to path integration is vestibular afference. We tested patients with reduced vestibular function (unilateral vestibular hypofunction, UVH), patients with aberrant vestibular function (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, BPPV), and  healthy participants (controls) on two linear path integration tasks: experimenter-guided walking and target-directed walking. The experimenter-guided walking task revealed a systematic underestimation of self-motion signals in UVH patients compared to the other groups. However, we  did not find any difference in the distance walked between the UVH group and the control group for the target-directed walking task. Results from neuropsychological testing and clinical balance measures suggest that the errors in experimenter-guided walking were not attributable to cognitive  and/or balance impairments. We conclude that impairment in linear path integration in UVH patients stem from deficits in self-motion perception. Importantly, our results also suggest that patients with a UVH deficit do not lose their ability to walk accurately without vision to a memorized  target location.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most frequent peripheral vestibular system disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of the Epley maneuver in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal (p-BPPV) and to discover possible causes of failure. This prospective study included 75 patients. In all the cases medical history showed and the positioning Dix-Hallpike test confirmed the diagnosis of p-BPPV. We also performed clinical ENT examination, searching for spontaneous nystagmus, vestibulospinal tests, caloric test, and audiometry. All the patients were treated by the modified Epley canalith repositioning maneuver. The patients were followed up at the intervals of seven and, fourteen days, and one, tree, and six months and one year. The maneuver was repeated if vertigo and nystagmus on control positioning test persisted. The transition from positive into negative Dix Hallpike test after one or two Epley maneuver was considered as success in treatment. After the initial Epley maneuver the recovery rate was 90.7%, and after the second 96%. In three (4%) patients with secondary p-BPPV, symptoms did not cease even after the second repositioning maneuver. The etiology of p-BPPV had a significant effect on the maneuver's success rate (p < 0.01), whereas duration of symptoms, age and gender had no effect (p > 0.05). After a successful treatment 11 (14.66%) patients had recurrent attack of BPPV during the first year. The Epley maneuver is very successful repositioning procedure in treating p-BPPV. The patients with idiopathic form p-BPPV showed higher success rate with Epley maneuver than those with secondary p-BPPV.</td>

	<td>The field of neuro-otology has advanced substantially over the past 150 years. The function of the vestibular system was presumed to be audiologic prior to the groundbreaking work of Prosper Ménière in the late 1800s. Since that time, scientific discovery has advanced our knowledge of the physiology and the pathophysiology of the vestibular system. This article describes where we have been, where we are now, and where we need to go from here. Some of the important recent advances include: (1) improved imaging of the brain and inner ear, (2) development of new eye movement recording and analysis techniques, (3) development of new tests of otolith function, (4) particle repositioning maneuvers for all types of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and (5) improved bedside diagnosis and treatment of vestibular neuritis. The cause and treatment for some common neuro-otologic disorders is now well delineated. The diagnosis and management of less common disorders has improved as well. Future work is still required to advance the science of vestibular physiology and pathophysiology and ultimately to discover new ways to improve the health of patients with these disorders.</td>

	<td>Transmastoid occlusion of the superior semicircular canal in superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) syndrome and the posterior semicircular canal in intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) will produce resolution of preoperative symptoms. Retrospective review, quality assurance. Sixteen patients with SSCD and 61 patients (65 ears) with intractable BPPV who underwent canal occlusion were reviewed. All patients underwent occlusion of the affected semicircular canal through a transmastoid approach. Preoperative symptoms (vestibular, 13 patients; pulsatile tinnitus, 2 patients; or hyperacusis, 1 patient) were greatly improved or completely resolved in 15 of the 16 SSCD patients who underwent transmastoid occlusion of the superior canal. Hearing was preserved in 14 patients and improved in two patients. Vestibular symptoms were resolved in all intractable BPPV patients who underwent transmastoid occlusion of the posterior canal. One patient had a late recurrence of atypical BPPV. Almost all BPPV patients with normal preoperative hearing have an initial transient postoperative hearing loss, which when tested for is usually a mild to moderate mixed loss. Delayed sensorineural hearing loss was noted in three patients; one loss was profound whereas two were mild. The transmastoid approach to canal plugging is successful in the treatment of symptoms in both SSCD and intractable BPPV, and is a familiar approach for the otologist. This is a viable alternative to the middle fossa approach for SSCD, thereby avoiding a craniotomy. Transmastoid is the definitive approach for posterior canal occlusion.</td>

	<td>Perturbation of semicircular canal function may result in a pathological angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR). The resulting impairment in gaze stabilization is perceived as "vertigo" or "dizziness" and may occur following receptor function impairment of all three semicircular canals. The head impulse test reveals hidden (covert-catchup) or visible (overt-catchup) saccades in disturbances of semicircular function. Most peripheral vestibular disorders can be treated conservatively. There are surgical treatment options for some diseases, such as intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Vestibular training promotes central reorganization of the VOR. Impaired semicircular receptor function, in particular bilateral vestibulopathy, may affect spatial orientation and cognitive processes. Balance prostheses could serve as a replacement for receptors in the future.</td>

Dix-Hallpike manoeuvres were performed to both ears, and groups were randomly allocated to have a morning, then afternoon, sequence of testing or vice versa. The results of the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvres were digitally recorded and reviewed by a second blinded assessor. A total of 27 of 50 participants (54%) tested positive on at least one of the days, six of 27 (22%) had discordant results. The difference in marginal proportions was 0% (95% confidence interval: -9.6 to 9.6), p=1.0.

One hundred and ninety-seven patients showed geotropic nystagmus in head rolling test with a mean latency period of (0.88 ± 0.72) s and a mean duration period of (26.36 ± 19.71) s. Forty-two patients showed apogeotropic nystagmus in head rolling test with a mean latency period of (2.69 ± 1.83) s and a mean duration period of (53.48 ± 43.12) s. Among all the horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients, 39 (16.3%) presented horizontal nystagmus with slight upbeating component. The nystagmus latency in apogeotropic nystagmus group was longer than that in geotropic nystagmus group (t = -6.33, P < 0.001), and nystagmus duration period was also longer (t = -3.99, P < 0.001). Applied Barbecue maneuver to the patients with geotropic nystagmus, 192 patients were cured after (1.6 ± 0.8) rotations; After applied head shaking maneuver to the patients with apogeotropic nystagmus, 40 patients changed to geotropic nystagmus and cured after (1.9 ± 0.8) rotations. Incidence rate of horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was higher than expectation. Barbecue maneuver was applied to patients with geotropic nystagmus. While to the patients with apogeotropic nystagmus, head shaking maneuver should be performed firstly and then followed by Barbecue maneuver.</td>

	<td>To assess the characteristics of the dysfunction of semicircular canal in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the relationship with the ectopic otoconia. There were 214 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), including 107 cases of posterior semicircular canal canalithiasis (PSC-Can) 80 cases of horizontal semicircular canal canalithiasis (HSC-Can), 27 cases of horizontal semicircular canal cupulolithiasis (HSC-Cup). One hundred and ninety (88.8%) patients were accompany with relevant diseases while 24 (11.2%) cases were not. They accepted low, middle and high frequency vestibular function tests, including caloric test (CT), head shaking test (HST) and video head impulse test (vHIT) respectively. The parameters of the unilateral weakness (UW), head shaking nystagmus (HSN) and video head impulse test gain (vHIT-G) were observed. Patients classified into three groups (PSC-Can, HSC-Can, HSC-Cup) according to the involvement semicircular canal. The results of the three tests were analyzed with SPSS16.0 software. The positive cases of the three tests were vHIT: 15 (7.0%), HST: 52 (24.3%), CT: 152 (71.0%), a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was found between the three tests. When compared the Caloric Test, HST and vHIT between the BPPV patients with and without relevant diseases, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05). The variance without statistical significance (P > 0.05) was showed between three tests' results in each groups, it was also showed that the variance between the three groups in each tests reached no statistical significance (P > 0.05). The test of affected side UW between PSC-Can, HSC-Can and HSC-Cup showed the variance without statistical significance (F = 0.970, P = 0.383). The lesion of semicircular canals has the same etiological factors with the utricle pathological change in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and the dysfunction mostly happens in low frequency range of semicircular canal frequency band. The ectopic otoconia is not the main etiological factors for that. HST and vHIT of middle and high frequency can not be ultimately used for the screening test evaluating due to the semicircular canal function in BPPV.</td>

The patients were classified into three groups: (1) IVN group, who showed only asymmetrical cVEMP responses; (2) superior VN (SVN) group, who showed only asymmetrical caloric responses; (3) total VN (TVN) group, who showed asymmetrical responses in both tests. The clinical records of time course of subjective symptoms (duration of attack, duration of hospitalization, and time to remission) were reviewed and other profiles (age, sex, affected side, acute symptoms, and sequelae) were evaluated. Of the 71 patients with VN, 13 (18%) were classified as having IVN. The mean age and time to remission of patients with IVN (44.2 ± 4.8 years, 0.9 ± 0.5 months) were significantly lower and shorter, respectively, than those of patients with TVN (57.3 ± 2.5 years, 4.9 ± 4.7 months).

The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 120 patients who were diagnosed with BPPV at the Dizziness Clinic in Ajou University Hospital, Korea, between 2004 and 2008. "Persistent" and "recurrent" BPPV were respectively defined as BPPV continuing more than 2 weeks and recurring BPPV in the same canals after at least 2 weeks of a symptom-free interval following previous successful treatments. The authors treated patients with frequently repeated CRPs such as the modified Epley maneuver or a barbecue rotation every 2 or 3 days in the outpatient clinic. Among 120 patients with BPPV, 93 (77.5%) were typical, 15 (12.5%) were persistent, and 12 (10.0%) were recurrent. Although the most common cause was idiopathic in both recurrent and persistent BPPV, secondary causes, including trauma, were much more common in recurrent and persistent BPPV than in typical BPPV. Typical and recurrent BPPV developed most commonly in the posterior semicircular canals. Persistent BPPV was most commonly detected in the lateral semicircular canals. After frequently repeated CRPs, 91.7% and 86.7% of the patients with recurrent or persistent BPPV, respectively, had resolution of nystagmus and vertigo. Recurrent and persistent BPPV are not rare diseases and occur with a higher incidence than expected, especially in patients with secondary causes. However, they can be successfully treated with frequently repeated CRPs.</td>

	<td>Few reliable tests are available for screening people rapidly for vestibular disorders although such tests would be useful for a variety of testing situations. Balance testing is widely performed but of unknown value for screening. The goal of this study was to determine the value of tests of walking balance for screening people with vestibular impairments. We tested three groups of patients with known vestibular impairments: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, unilateral vestibular weakness, and post-acoustic neuroma resection. We compared them to normal subjects. All subjects were independently ambulatory without gait aids. Subjects were tested on tandem walking (TW) with eyes open and eyes closed for 10 steps, walking with no additional head motions and with augmented head rotations in yaw for 7 m (WwHT), and an obstacle avoidance task, the Functional Mobility Test (FMT). Subjects wore a 3-D motion sensor centered at mid-torso to capture kinematic measures. Patients and normals differed significantly on some behavioral measures, such as the number of steps to perform TW, and on some but not all kinematic measures. ROC analyses, however, were at best only moderate, and failed to find strong differences and cut-points that would differentiate the groups. These findings suggest that although patients and normals differ in performance of these tests in some interesting ways the groups are not sufficiently different on these tests for easy use as screening tests to differentiate the populations.</td>

Patients with UW (n = 25) and BPPV (n = 25) were compared to normals (n = 50). Subjects looked into a clean bucket with a vertical line on the bottom, which rested on a table. It was rotated, clockwise or counterclockwise, for three trials per direction until the subject indicated that the line was vertical. The dependent measure was the mean absolute value of the deviations from the true vertical. Some, but not all, patients' responses differed from normal subjects but responses also differed by age and sex. ROC values were all weak, i.e. < 0.8. No good cut-off points differentiated controls from patients.

Eighty patients, all of whom were edentulous in the maxillary premolar and molar regions, were included in this prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups. In one group (40 patients, control group) sinus floor elevation was performed with an osteotome pushed by a hand mallet, and in the second group (40 patients, test group) sinus floor elevation was performed with the use of an electric mallet. One-hundred twenty dental implants (60 test, 60 control) were positioned. Intraoral digital radiographic examinations were made at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after implant placement. Alveolar bone height was measured and reported at 6, 12, and 24 months. After 24 months, a survival rate of 98.33% was reported. Three control group patients developed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following the use of osteotomes and percussion with the hand mallet. The mean alveolar bone gain at 6 months after implant placement was 2.64 ± 1.21 mm in the control group and 2.45 ± 1.55 mm in the test group. After 12 months, the bone height had increased in both groups, and at 24 months it was stable (4.17 ± 1.70 mm in the control group and 4.07 ± 1.03 mm in the test group). No statistically significant differences were seen between groups. A significant increase in bone height was achieved between 6 and 12 months, and bone levels remained stable at 2 years. The use of an electric mallet provided some essential advantages during surgery in comparison with the hand mallet.</td>

The primary endpoint of study was to show management of possible complication from temporal bone fractures and to analyze association with intracranial injuries. The second endpoint was to show incompleteness of traditionally classification of fracture type. Of the 52 patients with 54 fractures, 27 (50%) had longitudinal fractures, 4 (7.4%) had transverse fractures, 17 (31.5%) had temporal squama-mastoid fractures, 4 (7.4%) had mixed fractures and 2 (3.7%) had isolated meatal fracture. Fifty-eight percent of patients had at least one intracranial pathologic finding, of which 11% had two or more. Persistent conductive hearing loss was noted in 8 of 16 affected patients. The facial paralysis occurred in seven patients. One patient had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo developed 3 weeks after injury. In conclusion, rarely temporal bone fractures are isolated injures. The squama-mastoid fracture in most cases associated with intracranial injuries. Coordination between the neurosurgeon and otologist is essential in the care of such patients. Further large studies will be done to give a more complete classification of temporal bone fractures which will include all fracture patterns and predict clinical outcome.</td>

This type of positional vertigo is sustained by the action of intracranial tumors that mimics the clinical aspects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.Aim of this study is to clarify the features of these forms of positional vertigo, which we indicate as malignant paroxysmal positional vertigo. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of all the patients who presented with vertigo spells and were managed at our tertiary care referral centre over a three years period. Two hundred and eleven patients with diagnosis of positional paroxysmal vertigo were included in the final study. Seven patients were affected by intracranial tumors causing a positional vertigo and were classified as malignant paroxysmal positional vertigo patients after radiological and histological diagnosis. These patients were affected by an internal auditory canal mass alone or with extension in the cerebello pontine angle that mimicked a benign positional vertigo. We can conclude that the clinician should keep in mind the differentiation between benign positional vertigo and malignant positional vertigo. When the patients with positional vertigo presents a strange behaviour of symptoms, nystagmus or response to the canalith repositioning maneuver a radiological investigation must be undertaken in every doubtful case.</td>

	<td>Children complaints dizziness merit meticulous evaluation to differentially diagnose a vestibular disease. A syndrome mimicking certain classic signs and symptoms of adult vestibular disorders may be presents in children, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, usually associated with aging. Benign paroxysmal vertigo, in which migraine is a manifestation, with sudden onset of dizziness is a rare peripheral vestibular disorder that is commonly ignored or misdiagnosed. This review covers the development of the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment approaches of vertigo of childhood, a valid support for physician that approach dizzy children (Ref. 25).

	<td>The prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is becoming more frequent in elderly population. The presence of comorbid factors has to be considered before assessment as well as before commencing any repositioning treatment. Our aims were evaluation of the maneuvers efficacy and evaluation of the applicability of hybrid maneuver (HM) in patients with physical limitation. This is a randomized study in 2 tertiary referral centers. This is a therapeutic intervention. All consecutive patients with diagnosis of BPPV of posterior canal matching the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Patients underwent treatment soon after the initial diagnosis in all cases with a repositioning maneuver. The maneuver was casually selected among Semont, Epley, and hybrid. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the maneuver adopted. Eighty-eight patients with posterior canal BPPV were enrolled for treatment. Fisher exact test showed that no statistical differences exist between HM and other maneuvers in terms of efficacy. Latency of repositioning nystagmus appeared longer in HM in comparison with other maneuvers (P < .05). Efficacy of maneuvers used for BPPV decreases in case of cupulolithiasis (P < .0001). We found no relationship between age, sex, and length of disturbance on response to maneuvers. All maneuvers evaluated demonstrated similar efficacy. The HM, as our data showed, allows us to obtain a good percentage of success similar to most maneuvers used. It is also more comfortable for the patients with hip or neck functional limitation allowing an effective treatment of the posterior canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>This article synthesises recent findings and addresses relevant anatomy, pathophysiologic considerations, and current treatment options for common forms of acquired nystagmus including vestibular and gaze holding dysfunction. Some forms of nystagmus have relatively specific treatments, such as baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus, and repositioning for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Recent studies have brought changes to many of the treatments of nystagmus variants. Additionally, other recent advances in nystagmus treatment, like the usage of 4-aminopyridine, have added potent medications to the physician's armamentarium. Nystagmus is a commonly encountered entity in clinical practice. However, evidence supported treatments are scarce. Medical treatment of nystagmus is difficult, with often limited and variable response to pharmacologic therapies. This mandates a continued re-evaluation of patients and creation of an individualized approach to this common clinical problem.</td>

	<td>Recent studies show that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may also affect the macula of the saccule. We investigated vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) results in patients with BPPV. The study group included 31 patients (31 ears) diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV and the control group included 23 healthy volunteers (46 ears) with no neurotologic symptoms. After VEMP recordings were performed, mean latency values for p13 of the study and control groups were compared. VEMP responses were elicited in all controls (46 ears). In the study group, responses were normal in 19, delayed in 5, and absent in 7 ears. There was a significant difference between abnormal VEMP rates for patients versus controls (p < 0.001). Although VEMP responses were elicited in all non-affected ears of patients, there was a delayed response in 6 (19%) non-affected ears. This was statistically significant when compared with controls (p = 0.002). There was no correlation between abnormal VEMPs and the number of canalith reposition maneuvers required (p = 0.392). Our findings suggest the prolongation of mean latency values for p13 of VEMP in patients with BPPV might signify neuronal degeneration in the macula of the saccule, and the absence of VEMP waves might represent the extent of damage. Also, high latency values for p13 in non-affected ears of patients might indicate bilateral neural degeneration in BPPV.</td>

	<td>Most patients with dizziness have a benign self-limited condition, often of labyrinthine origin; however, some develop a more intractable form of dizziness that can be challenging to evaluate. In many of these patients, brain imaging, vestibular testing, and clinical examination are normal, but the patient is significantly impaired. Many such patients have coexisting anxiety, which can make it difficult to determine whether the anxiety is a reaction to the dizziness or its primary cause. A careful history, including an assessment of the impact of symptoms on quality-of-life, social, and work-related issues is critical, and effective patient communication is essential. The following case exemplifies how a high-functioning person can become severely limited because of the complex intertwining of several types of dizziness with anxiety.</td>

	<td>This article reviews the most common conditions that are caused by changes in head or body positions. Practical clinical methods to help distinguish vestibular from nonvestibular and central from peripheral vestibular positional dizziness are discussed. This article also reviews the treatment methods of selected canal variants of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Two recent evidence-based guidelines have established canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley and Semont maneuvers) as safe and highly effective in the treatment of posterior canal BPPV. Recent studies suggest the Gufoni and the Lempert roll (barbecue) maneuvers are effective in treating lateral canal forms of BPPV. Most cases of positional vertigo are of peripheral vestibular origin and can be effectively treated by simple positioning maneuvers. This article reviews the variants of BPPV encountered in clinical practice, including mechanistic cause, differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Generous use of figures is intended to aid in understanding the most effective treatment maneuver techniques for the more common forms of BPPV. Clinicians who can recognize the types of nystagmus associated with the various canal types of BPPV can usually recognize CNS causes as distinct.</td>

	<td>To determine the incidence, cause, and prevention of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (H-BPPV) and reentry into the common crus during canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). Prospective case series. Academic tertiary referral center. Forty-four patients with symptomatic posterior canalithiasis (P-BPPV) confirmed on Dix-Hallpike. Up to 5 CRP for initial P-BPPV and additional maneuvers for canal conversion or reentry in 1 session. Incidence and timing of onset of H-BPPV or common crus reentry and the outcome of treatment maneuvers. H-BPPV or reentry occurred during the Dix-Hallpike after a canal-clearing CRP and affected 16% (7/44) of subjects. Approximately 87% (7/8) of reentry or conversion events occurred after the very first CRP. Geotropic H-BPPV occurred in 9% (4/44) overall but in 13% (4/30) whose P-BPPV was resolved by a single CRP. All were cleared with H-BPPV maneuvers, 3 of 4 resolving with a single Gufoni maneuver. Approximately 9% (4/44) of patients developed reentry of particles into the common crus. It was treated by raising the patient to the upright position. By waiting 15 minutes after treatment of reentry, a final normal Dix-Hallpike was obtained without causing reentry into any canal in all patients. If the first CRP clears the posterior canal, there is an elevated risk of reentry or canal conversion if another Dix-Hallpike is performed immediately. These complications can be treated by additional maneuvers; if unfamiliar with these techniques, the risk can be reduced by waiting at least 15 minutes between repetitions of CRP.</td>

	<td>To identify under-diagnosed neuro-otological disorders and to evaluate whether under-diagnosing depends on the age of the patient. Retrospective analysis of medical charts from 951 consecutive patients (685 under and 266 above the age of 65 years) who entered diagnostic procedures at the Interdisciplinary Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Final diagnoses were compared to referral diagnoses. Relative to referral diagnoses, the proportion of patients finally diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) almost doubled both in younger (<65 year from 12.7 to 25.1%) and older patients (from 20.7 to 37.6%). Striking relative increases were found for the diagnoses multisensory dizziness in older patients (from 20.7 to 37.6%) and vestibular migraine in younger patients (1.8 to 20.2%). In both age groups, the proportion of patients with undetermined diagnoses was reduced by about 60% (younger: 69.8 to 9.8%; older: 69.2 to 12.4%) by the diagnostic procedures in the vertigo center. These changes were all significant (p < 0.05) in McNemar tests with continuity correction (2 × 2 tables: focused diagnosis vs. other diagnoses, referral vs. final). Significant changes of diagnoses can be expected by a specialized neuro-otological work-up. In particular, BPPV, multisensory dizziness, and vestibular migraine are under-diagnosed by referring physicians. This finding calls for better education of primary care takers in the field of neuro-otology.</td>

	<td>A 72-year-old man with positional vertigo and tinnitus was referred to us. He did not want to perform provoking test except once due to his fear. No positional nystagmus was provoked. He found that his attacks usually occurred when he lay on his right ear. From his clinical history, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was suspected. Conventional pharmacotherapy as well as non-specific physical therapy did not have significant effect. His feeling of positional vertigo with pyrosis was actually presyncope. We suspected cardiovascular disorders, and referred him to a cardiologist. Portable cardiogram monitoring revealed paroxysmal bradycardia. He was diagnosed with neurally mediated syncope, and a pacemaker was implanted. His paroxysmal dizziness soon disappeared. It is important to study the clinical history of the patients in detail, as they are not always able to accurately explain their symptoms. We should carefully rule out cardiovascular disorders, especially when we see the patients with suspected BPPV without the characteristic positional nystagmus.</td>

The second group received placebo drug 2 times daily for 1 week in addition to Epley maneuver, and the third group received 24 mg betahistine 2 times daily for 1 week in addition to Epley maneuver. The effectiveness of the treatments was assessed in each group as well as between them by analyzing and comparing data of 4 different vertigo symptom scales. Epley maneuver, alone or combined with betahistine or placebo, was found to be very effective with a primary success rate of 86.2%. The symptoms were significantly reduced in group 3 patients overall, and those patients younger or older than 50 years of age who had hypertension, with symptom onset <1 month, and with attack duration of less than a minute did significantly better with the combination of betahistine 48 mg daily. Betahistine in addition to Epley maneuver is more effective than Epley maneuver alone or combined with placebo with regard to improvement of symptoms in certain patients. However, future clinical studies covering more patients to investigate the benefit of medical treatments in addition to Epley maneuver are needed.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxsymal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo associated with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology (ENT) clinics. BPPV of the posterior canal is a specific type of BPPV for which the Epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre is a verified treatment. A range of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre are used in clinical practice, including post-Epley vestibular exercises and post-Epley postural restrictions. To assess whether the various modifications of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV enhance its efficacy in clinical practice. We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 December 2011. Randomised controlled trials of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre versus a standard Epley manoeuvre as a control in adults with posterior canal BPPV diagnosed with a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Specific modifications sought were: application of vibration/oscillation to the mastoid region, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre and post-treatment instructions relating to movement restriction. Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and the third author reviewed and resolved any disagreement. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised data forms. All authors independently assessed the trials for risk of bias. The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients.There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre. No adverse effects were reported. There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone. However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy. An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances.There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treatment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a mechanical peripheral vestibular disorder which may involve any of the three semicircular canals but principally the posterior. In as much as the literature has described theories to explain the mechanism of BPPV and also contains scholarly works that elucidate BPPV; its management remains an enigma to most clinicians. To this end, this work was aimed at outlining an evidence-based best practice for most common form of BPPV. A systematic review of the literature was conducted between 1948 and June 2011 in PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane database through the online Library of the University of Cape Town. Seventy-nine worthy articles that addressed the study were selected on consensus of the two authors. There is consensus for the use of canalith repositioning procedures as the best form of treatment for posterior canal canalolithiasis. However, successful treatment is dependent on accurate identification of the implicated canal and the form of lithiasis. Furthermore, clinicians should note that there is no place for pharmacological treatment of BPPV; unless it is to facilitate repositioning.</td>

We analyzed her nystagmus three-dimensionally. At the first visit, she showed vertical-torsio nystagmus of the posterior canal type of BPPV (P-BPPV) and subsequently showed recently reported geotropic nystagmus with a long time constant. Two weeks later, she showed apogeotropic nystagmus of the horizontal canal type of BPPV (AH-BPPV) and subsequently a geotropic nystagmus with a short time constant of the horizontal canal type of BPPV (GH-BPPV). Three kind of nystagmus, namely P-BPPV, AH-BPPV and GH-BPPV can be explained by the otoconial debris hypothesis of the same ear. Finally, the recently reported geotropic nystagmus with a long time constant may be explained by a reversible lesion such as the denatured cupula or utricular imbalance of the same ear.</td>

	<td>To analyze the misdiagnosed cases with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). During October 2010 to January 2011, a total of 287 patients with dizziness visited the Dizziness Clinic at Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University. Forty-eight misdiagnosed cases with BPPV were collected and their clinical data were analyzed. All 48 cases were diagnosed by the Dix-Hallpike or Roll test maneuver. (1) CLINICAL FEATURES: there were 38 females and 10 males with an average age of 54 ± 12 years old (range: 31 - 87). Posterior semicircular canal was involved in 75.0% (36/48) whereas the horizontal semicircular and multiple canals in 20.8% (10/48) and 4.2% (2/48) respectively. All patients were treated successfully. And 41 cases (85.4%) were cured on the first visiting day. Recurrences of BPPV occurred in 6 cases during the follow-up. (2) The initial visiting departments consisted of the department of general internal medicine 43.8% (21/48), department of neurology 27.1% (13/48), department of osteology 18.7% (9/48), ear, nose &amp; throat (ENT) department 2.1% (1/48) and other departments 8.3% (4/48). In addition, 68.7% (33/48) of them frequented the general out-patient clinics during their initial visits and the other 31.3% (15/48) used the emergency services. (3) The initial diagnoses included vertebrobasilar insufficiency/cerebral circulation insufficiency 27.1% (13/48), cervical spondylosis 27.1% (13/48), cerebral infarction 4.2% (2/48), Meniere's disease 2.1% (1/48) and others 10.4% (5/48); Besides, 29.1% (14/48) of them had no diagnosis. (4) The average clinic visits per patient were 3.4 times (164 visits/48 cases). (5) The most commonly performed tests included brain computed tomography (CT) (28 person-times), cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (19 person-times), brain MRI (18 person-times), cervical radiography (18 person-times) and cervical CT (8 person-times). In these misdiagnosed cases of BPPV, most of them were middle-aged women. They were most likely to have their first consultations in the departments of general internal medicine and neurology. Therefore these two departments should pay more attention to applying the maneuver of Dix-Hallpike or Roll test so as to reduce the misdiagnosis of BPPV and the waste of healthcare resources.</td>

	<td>This study suggests that adjuvant anti-anxiety medication may be helpful for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) even after a successful canalith repositioning procedure (CRP). Although the CRP is an effective treatment for BPPV, many patients suffer from persistent dizziness despite successful CRPs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adjuvant anxiolytic medication on residual dizziness after successful CRP. Between January 2011 and March 2011, 73 patients were diagnosed with BPPV and they underwent successful treatment with CRPs. The patients were randomly assigned to either the medication group or the control group. The patients in the medication group were prescribed low dose etizolam for 2 weeks whereas the patients in the control group were not prescribed any medication. All patients were scheduled to return 2 weeks after evaluation of subjective visual vertical. Subjective symptoms before and after CRP were measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in DHI scores. However, the medication group showed significantly greater decrease in the functional (p = 0.018) and emotional (p = 0.030) subscale scores, as well as in the total DHI (p = 0.038) score.</td>

	<td>To evaluate the effectiveness of a canalith-repositioning procedure in postural control of older patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Prospective clinical trial. A tertiary referral center. A 9-month follow-up survey with a prospective design was conducted among 33 older patients with BPPV. Patients underwent static posturography (Balance Rehabilitation Unit [BRU]) and were administered the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) before and after the maneuver. After the treatment, they were compared with 33 healthy older subjects. The posturography parameters were the limit of stability (LOS), the center of body-pressure area (COP), and the velocity of oscillation (VOS) under conditions of visual, somatosensory, and visual-vestibular conflict. One canalith-repositioning procedure relieved most patients' complaints (54.5%), and 100% were relieved with 1 to 3 maneuvers. Total DHI score and all subscales improved after treatment (P < .01). The LOS values pretreatment (mean [SD] 134.27 [55.32] cm(2)) and posttreatment (181.03 [47.79] cm(2)) were significantly different (P < .01). Comparative analysis of COP values showed a relevant statistical difference in 8 of 10 postmaneuver conditions (P < .01). The postmaneuver VOS showed a significant difference under 7 conflict conditions. There were no differences between the healthy older subjects and treated patients for all VOS values under all conditions and for COP values under 9 conditions. The canalith-repositioning procedure promotes remission of symptoms, an increase in LOS, and improvement in postural control under conditions of somatosensory and visual conflict and visual-vestibular interaction.</td>

The Epley maneuver (EM) is a simple and effective treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) of the posterior canal. However, the maneuver is underused in routine care. In this study, we aimed to describe and analyze the available information about the EM on youtube.com. A YouTube search was performed on August 31, 2011, for videos that demonstrated the entire EM. Detailed data were abstracted from each video and corresponding Web site. Videos were rated on the accuracy of the maneuver by 2 authors, with differences resolved by adjudication. Comments posted by viewers were assessed for themes regarding video use. Of the 3,319 videos identified, 33 demonstrated the EM. The total number of hits for all videos was 2,755,607. The video with the most hits (802,471) was produced by the American Academy of Neurology. Five of the videos accounted for 85% of all the hits. The maneuver demonstration was rated as accurate in 64% (21) of the videos. Themes derived from the 424 posted comments included patients self-treating with the maneuver after reviewing the videos, and providers using the videos as a prescribed treatment or for educational purposes. Accurate video demonstration of the Epley maneuver is available and widely viewed on YouTube. Video-sharing media may be an important way to disseminate effective interventions such as the EM. The impact of video Web sites on outcomes and costs of care is not known and warrants future study.</td>

Retrospective case series. We retrospectively analyzed 519 patients with ISSHL and 597 patients with i-BPPV. The ISSHL patients with recent vertigo history before or after admission were tested with video-nystagmography that included the caloric test. BPPV with same-side ISSHL was identified and categorized as secondary BPPV (s-BPPV) using the roll or Dix-Hallpike test. All members of the s-BPPV and i-BPPV groups underwent a daily canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) during the admission periods. We investigated the clinical characteristics, including the number of CRPs performed to achieve successful reposition, canal involvement type, and effect of canal paresis and made comparisons between the s-BPPV and i-BPPV groups. Of the 519 ISSHL patients, 63 (12.1%) were identified as having s-BPPV. Multicanal involvement was more frequent in s-BPPV than i-BPPV patients (P < .001). The mean number of CRPs needed to achieve successful reposition was 4.28 in s-BPPV and 1.34 in i-BPPV (P < .001). The presence of canal paresis was also associated with a greater number of CRPs required for s-BPPV (P < .02). In about 12% of ISSHL patients, s-BPPV was concurrent. More CRPs were required for successful repositioning in patients with s-BPPV than in patients with i-BPPV. Also, the presence of canal paresis in s-BPPV was associated with a greater number of required CRPs.</td>

	<td>To determine the immediate and long-term therapeutic efficacies of barbecue rotation and Gufoni maneuvers, a randomized, prospective, and sham-controlled study was conducted in patients with the geotropic type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the horizontal semicircular canal (HC-BPPV). In 10 nationwide dizziness clinics in Korea, 170 consecutive patients (107 women, age range 11-97 years, mean age ± SD 61 ± 15 years, median = 61 years) with geotropic HC-BPPV were randomly assigned to barbecue rotation (n = 56), Gufoni (n = 64), or sham maneuver (n = 50). An immediate response was determined within 1 hour after a maximum of 2 trials of each maneuver on the visit day. We also assessed the cumulative results of each maneuver by following up the patients for 1 month. After a maximum of 2 maneuvers on the initial visit day, barbecue rotation (38 of 55 [69.1%]) and Gufoni (39 of 64 [60.9%]) maneuvers showed better responses than the sham maneuver (17 of 48 [35.4%]). The cumulative therapeutic effects were also better with barbecue rotation (p = 0.006) and Gufoni (p = 0.031) maneuvers than with the sham maneuver. However, therapeutic efficacies did not differ between the barbecue rotation and Gufoni groups in terms of both immediate (p = 0.46) and long-term (p = 0.10) outcomes. Using a prospective randomized trial, we demonstrated that barbecue rotation and Gufoni maneuvers are effective in treating geotropic HC-BPPV. This study provides Class I evidence that barbecue rotation and Gufoni maneuvers are effective in the treatment of geotropic HC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>To evaluate the characteristics of head shaking nystagmus in various peripheral vestibular diseases. Retrospective case series. Tertiary referral center. Data of 235 patients with peripheral vestibular diseases including vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, were retrospectively analyzed. All subjects presented between August 2009 and July 2010. Patients were tested for vestibular function including head shaking nystagmus and caloric information. Regarding vestibular neuritis, all tests were again performed during the 1-month follow-up. Head shaking nystagmus was classified as monophasic or biphasic and, according to the affected ear, was divided as ipsilesional or contralesional. Of the 235 patients, 87 patients revealed positive head shaking nystagmus. According to each disease, positive rates of head shaking nystagmus were as follows: 35 (100%) of 35 cases of vestibular neuritis, 11 (68.8%) of 16 cases of Ménière's disease, and 41 (22.2%) of 184 cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. All cases of vestibular neuritis initially presented as a monophasic, contralesional beating, head shaking nystagmus. However, 1 month after first visit, the direction of nystagmus was changed to biphasic (contralesional first then ipsilesional beating) in 25 cases (72.5%) but not in 10 cases (27.5%). There was a significant correlation between the degree of initial caloric weakness and the biphasic conversion of head shaking nystagmus (p = 0.02). In 72.5% of vestibular neuritis cases, head shaking nystagmus was converted to biphasic during the subacute period. The larger the initial canal paresis was present, the more frequent the biphasic conversion of head shaking nystagmus occurred. However, Ménière's disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo did not have specific patterns of head shaking nystagmus.</td>

We present a patient with nodular infarction who had positional vertigo with nystagmus as a sole manifestation. Video-oculography showed apogeotropic positional horizontal nystagmus during head turning while supine, which was consistent with apogeotropic BPPV involving the horizontal canal. MRI disclosed acute infarct in the nodulus. Nodulus infarction should be considered in a patient with positional nystagmus, especially when the presenting symptoms and signs are consistent with BPPV involving the horizontal canal.</td>

The study also documented the relative incidence of each semicircular canal involvement. Case-control study. Academic tertiary otologic practice. Ninety patients diagnosed with SSNHL with vertigo were enrolled. Clinical characteristics such as gender, age, and pure tone audiogram threshold were compared between group A (SSNHL with BPPV, n = 17) and group B (SSNHL without BPPV, n = 73). The frequency of each canal involvement was compared between group A and another 111 patients with BPPV only (group C). The proportion of patients with hearing recovery was compared between patients with or without BPPV, and between those with or without canal paresis. Patients in group A did not display significant differences in the sex ratio, mean age, or initial results of pure tone audiogram threshold compared with those in group B. Most patients with SSNHL with BPPV had lateral canal canalithiasis (64.7%). The presence of BPPV had no influence on the recovery of hearing. The clinical characteristics of patients with SSNHL with BPPV were not different from those with SSNHL without BPPV. The lateral canal was the most frequently involved, and the presence or absence of BPPV had no dramatic impact on the outcome of SSNHL.</td>

	<td>Positional vertigo is a common neurologic emergency and mostly the etiology is peripheral. However, central diseases may mimic peripheral positional vertigo at their initial presentation. We here describe the results of a visual suppression test in six patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), a central positional vertigo, and nine patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the major peripheral positional vertigo. As a result, the visual suppression value of both diseases differed significantly; e.g., 22.5% in SCA6 and 64.3% in BPPV (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the visual suppression value and disease duration, cerebellar atrophy, and CAG repeat length of SCA6 but they were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the present study showed for the first time that visual suppression is impaired in SCA6, a central positional vertigo, but preserved in BPPV, the major peripheral positional vertigo, by directly comparing both groups. The abnormality in the SCA6 group presumably reflects dysfunction in the central visual fixation pathway at the cerebellar flocculus and nodulus. This simple test might aid differential diagnosis of peripheral and central positional vertigo at the earlier stage of disease. </td>

	<td>Studies have shown that 65% of people with dizziness may have a vestibular etiologic diagnosis, possibly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The diagnosis of BPPV is based on medical history and findings after the Dix-Hallpike test. It is sometimes difficult to perform the Dix-Hallpike test in elderly persons, due to the limited range of motion when extending the neck. In this study, we used a side-lying test to stimulate the posterior semicircular canal, while the head and neck were fully supported on the examination table. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of dizziness and/or impaired balance and BPPV in a population of 75-year-olds by means of a questionnaire and clinical tests, and to compare elderly persons with and without BPPV. A representative population sample of 675 persons completed a questionnaire about dizziness and 571 persons underwent side-lying, static balance and dynamic walking tests. Subjective dizziness and/or impaired balance were found in 36% of subjects, especially when walking outdoors. A significant gender difference was found, with a higher prevalence in women (40%) compared with men (30%) (p<0.01). BPPV was found in 11% and was significantly more common in women (p<0.01). Elderly individuals with BPPV also displayed significantly impaired balance in static and dynamic balance tests compared with persons without BPPV (p<0.01). Persons with BPPV reported significantly more sub- jective problems with dizziness and balance compared with persons without BPPV (p<0.001). Subjective and objective unsteadiness, dizziness and BP- PV are common in the elderly.</td>

	<td>Spontaneous nystagmus, which has been considered a typical sign of acute vestibulopathy, has recently been reported in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the lateral semicircular canals (LC-BPPV) without unilateral vestibulopathy (pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus, PSN), but research about its clinical application is still limited. Here we investigate the frequency and characteristics of PSN in LC-BPPV patients, and estimate its prognostic value. For 95 patients with LC-BPPV, we examined nystagmus in the sitting position in the clinic with video goggles. Patients were categorized as PSN or non-PSN, according to presence of horizontal nystagmus in the sitting position at diagnosis. The duration of vertiginous symptoms before diagnosis and the duration of treatment were compared between the two groups. The results of video-nystagmography test were reviewed when available. PSN was examined in 16 (16.8%) patients, all of whose symptoms disappeared immediately after successful repositioning therapy. While the duration of symptoms did not differ statistically between groups (P=0.481), the duration of treatment in the PSN group was significantly longer than in the non-PSN group (P<0.001). We conclude that the presence of spontaneous nystagmus in the sitting position does not preclude a diagnosis of LC-BPPV without unilateral vestibulopathy. PSN was related to a poor outcome of LC-BPPV in this study.</td>

Subsequently, arrive at implications for clinical practices and set foundation for future research. Consecutive traumatic SCI patients who were admitted to the rehabilitation centre during the period from August 2008 to December 2010 were screened for BPPV using the Dix-Hallpike test and roll test. The treatment efficacy was reflected by the number of treatment required for complete resolution of BPPV symptoms. Modified assessment and treatment techniques were employed for people with cervical SCI. A total of 62 subjects were included and the overall incidence of BPPV was 14.5%. People with cervical SCI were 2.87 times more likely to have BPPV compared to people with thoracic/ lumbar SCI. The treatment efficacy for posterior and horizontal canal canalithiasis were 75% and 100% respectively with one manoeuvre. All BPPVs were resolved within three manoeuvres without any complication. All conventional and modified BPPV assessment and treatment techniques were found to be safe in people with traumatic SCI. This is the first study to look into the incidence and treatment efficacy of BPPV in people with traumatic SCI. The high incidence is worth clinicians' attentions. The treatments were also highly effective for immediate symptoms resolution. We recommend that assessments and treatments for BPPV could be incorporated into the standard care for people with traumatic SCI.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is among the commonest of chief complaints. It often presents a significant challenge to the attending physician, because the symptoms and signs are often vague and non-specific. However, a robust systematic approach can usually arrive at the diagnosis. Maintaining balance requires sensory inputs from the vestibular, visual, and somatosensory systems and the cerebellum fine-tunes inaccurate motor outputs. Causes of vertigo are most commonly otological, followed by central, somatosensory, and visual. The first question in approaching patients with dizziness is to categorise dizziness into one of the four groups: lightheadedness, pre-syncope, disequilibrium, and vertigo. Secondly, central vertigo has to be differentiated with peripheral vertigo. For peripheral vertigo, the most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and should be specifically looked for. The tempo of the vertiginous attacks and other associated symptoms can help differentiate the other causes of peripheral vertigo, including Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, and a perilymph fistula.</td>

The analysis included age, sex distribution, natural history, pure-tone audiometry, caloric response, age at onset, and the characteristics of vertigo. Median follow-up was 63.1 months (range, 24-103 months). Patients had a mean age at onset of 39 years and a mean duration of 4.2 years. An obvious female predilection was found, and unilateral caloric paresis (≥ 25%) was seen in 35%. Of the 98 patients, symptoms resolved in 82% but were unchanged in 12%. RV developed to Ménière's disease in four patients and to migraine in two. No patient with RV developed a central nervous system disease or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo during follow-up. The study suggests that in the majority of cases, vertigo spontaneously resolves and that the risks of development to Ménière's disease or migraine are low.</td>

Twenty-six out of 40 BPPV patients got abnormal caloric test results; 33 patients got DPG abnormality which led to a low vestibular perception scores. Twenty-four out of these patients got abnormal results in both caloric test and DPG, while in 9 patients that got normal caloric results came up with low vestibular perception scores, except for which there was no significant abnormality in SOT. Besides, the BPPV patients, compared with normal, got abnormal scores in caloric test of ENG and vestibular perception test of DPG (P < 0.05), if course of BPPV was over 12 months, higher abnormal degrees appeared (P < 0.05).

	<td>Otology concerns the biological study of ear alterations and diseases, solely. So, the diagnosis of audiovestibular diseases tends to be idiopathic or is based on theoretical concepts such as idiopathic sudden deafness, Ménière disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, tinnitus, hyperacusis, or idiopathic facial paralysis. The treatment for these pathologies is symptomatic. Otosociology takes the aetiology and pathogenesis of the ear and situates them within the social and cultural environment of the patient. Then, audiovestibular disease is based on evidence, and the treatment options seek to solve the causes and consequences produced. Otosociology should be considered as a new discipline. Otosociology came into being since otology does not provide definitive solutions for the audiovestibular alterations produced from the point of view of the ear, whereas otosociology finds these solutions within the social/cultural environment of the patient. Where otology emphasises the diseases of the ear, otosociology deals with social manifestations. Where otology deals with idiopathic diseases, otosociology deals with causes and pathogeny produced by interactions in the social and cultural surroundings of the patient. Where otology offers symptomatic treatment, otosociology offers treatment of causes and consequences. Otosociology can fill significant voids in audiovestibular processes from the perspective of the patient's social environment.</td>

Subjects were followed up twice (1 and 24 h) with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver by blinded examiners. At the 1 and 24 h follow-up, 79.3 and 86.8%, respectively, of patients undergoing SLM had recovered from vertigo, compared to none of the patients undergoing the sham maneuver (p < 0.0001). Patients who manifested liberatory nystagmus at the end of SLM showed a significantly higher percentage of recovery (87.1 vs. 55.7%; p < 0.0001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Class I study on the efficacy of SLM. SLM proved highly effective with respect to the sham maneuver (p < 0.0001). Liberatory nystagmus was demonstrated to be a useful prognostic factor for the efficacy of treatment. The present Class I study of efficacy of SLM changes the level of recommendation of the maneuver for treating PC-BPPV from level C to level B.</td>

CT images of the posterior canal were evaluated postoperatively in a patient with intractable BPPV, in whom the unilateral posterior and lateral semicircular canals were irradiated with an argon laser. In addition, bootstrap analysis of 20 patients with normal CT findings of the temporal bone was performed and previous experimentally obtained histologic findings were compared. Cross-sections of the posterior canals of 20 patients were found to show no difference in size between the right and left sides. The laser-irradiated posterior canal became narrower than that on the non-irradiated healthy side in our patient. There was a discrepancy between the CT images and experimentally obtained histologic findings that showed complete occlusion of the canal. CT images of a patient with severe vertigo demonstrated that argon laser irradiation to the blue-lined semicircular canals did not occlude the canal of the corresponding areas, while the canal of the guinea pig histologically showed complete obstruction with new bone after irradiation with the same energy (1.5 W, 0.5 s, spot size: around 200 μm in diameter). The patient has been free from vertigo for 16 years. Marked constriction of the semicircular duct corresponding to the irradiated area appeared to be effective in treating intractable BPPV.</td>

We diagnosed each disease based on neuro-otological examinations and investigated the characteristics of menopausal-associated vertigo. We studied 413 women aged 40-59 years old who complained of vertigo. There were 73 women with menopause symptoms (14 women introduced from the gynecologist in our medical center, 18 women had undergone treatment at another female clinic, and 41 women visited an otorhinolaryngologist first) compared with 340 women without menopause symptoms. In the menopause group, 41 (56.2%) cases were diagnosed as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 13 (17.8%) cases had Meniere's disease, sudden deafness with vertigo accounted 2 cases, one was an acoustic tumor, and so on. The percentage of patients with BPPV was almost same ratio between the menopause group (56.2%) and the non-menopause group (52.9%). The percentage of patients with Meniere's disease was higher markedly in the menopausal group (17.8%). than the non-menopause group (9.7%). Menopausal symptoms are caused not only by hot flashes related to a lack of estrogen but also by psychological factors. The onset of Meniere's disease can also be influenced by psychological factors. As for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, we supposed the reason for the higher percentage in the menopausal group was its relationship with psychological factors. We could diagnose and treat some menopausal women with vertigo. We believe that joint consultation with a gynecologist and otorhinolaryngologist would be necessary to ensure an optimum quality of life for such patients.</td>

In this study, postural restrictions did not appear to significantly affect the outcomes of repositioning maneuvers, as well as the recurrence rate. Conclusions. Although this study, as well as most recent control studies, states that there is no significant effect of postmaneuver postural restrictions on both treatment and recurrence rates, larger multicentric research projects, adopting improved methodology, are still necessary in order to determine the contribution of such restrictions to both the therapeutic results and the prevention of recurrence. Adequate followup, focusing on the first six months after the initially successful repositioning maneuver, is also of paramount importance.</td>

	<td>To determine the recurrence rate of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) and the factors associated to such recurrences. Prospective study. Sixty-nine consecutive patients treated for first episode of BPPV. 63 months. Mean follow-up: 47 months. The recurrence rate was 27%. Fifty percent of recurrences occurred in the first 6 months. Nineteen patients had 1 or more recurrence of BPPV; 10 had 1 recurrence, 7 patients had 2, and 2 patients had 3 recurrences. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate according to sex, age, side, cause of BPPV, or instability after successful treatment. Multi-canal BPPV (log-rank, p = 0.024) and anterior canal BPPV (log-rank, p = 0.029) showed a significantly greater tendency to recur and to do so earlier. There was a significant difference in time to recurrence related to the number of maneuvers used to resolve the initial BPPV episode (log-rank, p = 0.023). Except for cases of BPPV secondary to labyrinthitis or neurolabyrinthitis, at least 70% of the recurrences affected a different side and/or different canal than the primary BPPV. The recurrence rate of BPPV is 27%, and relapse largely occurs in the first 6 months. When BPPV recurrence is suspected, every canal on both sides must be investigated because it is the BPPV syndrome that recurs, rather than BPPV affecting a particular side or canal. Complex cases of BPPV have a greater risk of recurrence.</td>

	<td>Psychologic studies in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are scarce, considering the high frequency of the disorder. We performed a repeated-measures design questionnaire study in a cohort of patients with BPPV before and after treatment to investigate the dynamics of the psychologic findings and possible treatment consequences. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with idiopathic BPPV participated in the study. During the first visit and 2 to 3 months after therapy, the patients completed 4 questionnaires: the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The scores for all questioned items did not change before and after treatment except for the physical handicap scores. Correlation was found between the grade of functional and emotional impact of the disease and belief in consequences as well as anxiety levels of the patients. Moreover, uncertainty scores were in correlation with emotional impact, anxiety levels, and perceived consequences of the disease. The belief in personal control of the condition was correlated with the belief in treatment control and understanding of the disease. The main finding in this study is the lack of a significant change in beliefs and emotional reactions in patients with BPPV after treatment of their condition. Physicians dealing with BPPV should be aware that the disease is not solely a somatic condition but has a serious impact on the patient's mental state. Selected patients might benefit from anxiolytic medication.</td>

Included in this study are 6 patients diagnosed with bilateral BPPV refractory to medical treatment and particle repositioning maneuvers (PRMs) who underwent bilateral posterior semicircular canal occlusions. Patients were selected from tertiary hospital referral centers in London, Ontario, Canada, and St. Louis, Missouri, USA. This study used the following interventions: preoperative and postoperative audiogram testing to monitor long-term changes in hearing, computed tomography of the head to rule out central lesions and confirm normal inner ear anatomy before surgery, magnetic resonance imaging of the head as needed to rule out posterior fossa lesions causing persistent vertigo, Dix-Hallpike maneuver to diagnose BPPV, PRM and physiotherapy vestibular rehabilitation to attempt treating BPPV before surgical intervention, and sequential transmastoid posterior semicircular canal occlusion for treatment of intractable BPPV. Postoperative resolution of vertigo induced by head movement and hearing preservation by audiometric testing and postural stability. All patients with severe debilitating bilateral BPPV refractory to medical treatment and PRM had complete resolution of their positional vertigo after bilateral sequential posterior semicircular canal occlusion. Hearing was preserved at the preoperative level in all but 1 patient who developed bilateral postoperative, mild, high-tone sensorineural loss. Residual postoperative adverse effects included transient imbalance in all patients and episodic, nonpositional vertigo in 1 patient. When stressed by extreme head motion, some patients had mild residual instability. There were no other significant long-term complications. Bilateral sequential posterior semicircular canal occlusion is a definitive, effective, and safe treatment modality for intractable bilateral BPPV, providing patients with resolution of their vertiginous symptoms. All 6 patients stated that the alleviation of their BPPV symptoms far out-weighed the residual motion sensitivity resulting from the occluded canals.</td>

The aims of the present study were two-fold. (1) To examine the association between the preferred side of head-lying during sleep and the side of the affected ear in patients with both posterior canal BPPV (P-BPPV) and horizontal canal BPPV (H-BPPV). (2) To see whether that position affects the time course in remission of their positional vertigo. One hundred and sixteen patients with P-BPPV and 40 patients with H-BPPV who showed a habitual preference for right or left side sleeping position were included in this study. The side of the affected ear was significantly associated with the head-lying side during sleep in patients with P-BPPV and was closely but not significantly associated with it in patients with H-BPPV. However, the head-lying side during sleep did not affect the remission rate of their positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an uncommon complication that can develop after cochlear implantation. This condition has been documented in adults as a complication of cochlear implant surgery. However, there is no reported literature on BPPV in children who have undergone cochlear implant surgery. A 13-year-old girl underwent the insertion of a cochlear implant and developed BPPV as a result of visiting fairground rides approximately 2 years after surgery. We performed a right Epley's maneuver. She was advised to do Brandt-Daroff exercises for 6 weeks. She became symptom free within a few weeks of doing vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Nevertheless, she had been compliant with vestibular rehabilitation for 6 weeks. The vibration injury to the labyrinth caused during the various rides could be analogous to the mechanism of trauma to the labyrinth as occurs during head injury. The other possibility could be dislodgement of the otoconia from the already vulnerable utricle that has been subject to cochlear implantation. It is presumed that the vulnerability of the labyrinth following the cochlear implantation happened as the child suffered from dizziness in the immediate post-operative period. However, a chance association between the insertion of the cochlear implant and the development of the symptoms of BPPV in this patient cannot be ruled out.</td>

	<td>To determine whether any particular head positions during sleep are associated with BPPV, head position during sleep was monitored for 3 days in 50 BPPV patients after the disappearance of positional nystagmus and in 25 normal control subjects. A gravity sensor was attached to the center of the subject's forehead at home. The positional angle of the head was measured at 5-second intervals during sleep. In BPPV, the posterior semicircular canal was involved in 40 patients and the lateral semicircular canal in 10 patients. Recurrence was found in 22 of 50 BPPV patients. BPPV patients with recurrence were significantly more likely to sleep in the affected-ear-down 45-degree head position than were patients with no history of recurrence (P< 0.02). When the head is in the affected-ear-down 45-degree head position, the non-ampullated half of the posterior semicircular canal and the non-ampullated half of the lateral semicircular canal are nearly in the earth-vertical position, making it easier for detached otoconia to fall into the posterior or lateral semicircular canal and to agglomerate and attain a certain size in the lowest portion of each semicircular canal. Our findings showed that the affected-ear-down 45-degree head position during sleep could be an etiological factor of BPPV, more particularly in patients with recurrent BPPV.</td>

Of a total of 425 patients diagnosed with BPPV, 83 patients showing signs of simultaneous multiple canal involvement, and those having combined otologic diseases in the same ear were excluded from the study. All patients included in the study were asked to define their preferred head-lying side at the beginning of sleep among the following choices: supine, lateral (right or left), or no predominant side. Our study included 174 patients with posterior SCC BPPV (p-BPPV) and 168 patients with horizontal SCC BPPV (h-BPPV). Patients habitually adopted a lateral head position during sleep in 105 cases of p-BPPV and 109 cases of h-BPPV. Statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the head-lying side during sleep and the affected side by BPPV (P < .01) in patients with p-BPPV as well as h-BPPV. There is significant correlation between the head-lying side during sleep and the side affected by BPPV in h-BPPV and p-BPPV, which may provide additional clues about the pathophysiology of BPPV. Clinically, this information may be used to provide helpful guidelines for patients with BPPV concerning their sleeping positions to prevent recurrence of BPPV.</td>

All patients diagnosed with BPPV and MD received treatment in the ENT clinic. The Brazilian DHI questionnaire, which assesses the quality of life with a focus on physical, emotional, and functional aspects, was used for data collection, and was completed by patients before the first session and after the fifth session of VR. Data were tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, followed by Wilcoxon, Friedman, and Spearman correlation tests (p < 0.05).  There were significant improvements in scores for all aspects, with median changes ranging from 12 to 0 in the physical, 6 to 1 in the emotional, and 11 to 1 in the functional aspect. There were no correlations between the scores and sample characteristics.  VR was an effective method for the treatment of patients with BPPV and MD; it improves quality of life and shows the maximal influence on physical aspect scores, regardless of age or gender.</td>

	<td>Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) may precipitate secondary benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), especially in pediatric populations, as well as paretic dysfunction of the vestibular end organ. EVA is characterized by the early onset of sudden or progressive sensorineural hearing loss with or without vestibular dysfunction. However, vestibular dysfunction in patients with EVA has not been described as frequently as hearing loss, and an association with BPPV has not been previously reported. By reviewing the cochleo-vestibular status of three children and two young adults with EVA who had been diagnosed with BPPV, characteristic features of BPPV in EVA patients were investigated and possible pathogenetic mechanisms are speculated. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for five patients with EVA who presented with BPPV from January 2004 to July 2009. Clinical courses, characteristics of vertigo and audiovestibular laboratory findings were reviewed. Among 26 patients with radiologically confirmed EVA, 5 (19.2%) exhibited positional nystagmus compatible with BPPV through Dix-Hallpike and head-roll tests. Hearing loss usually accompanied BPPV attacks, and BPPV was recurrent in three patients. Multiple semicircular canals were frequently involved in each episode, and different canals were also involved in recurrent cases. Canalith repositioning procedures were usually successful without difficulty.</td>

Otologic and neurotologic examinations, pure-tone audiometry (PTA), vestibular function tests, and brain magnetic resonance imagings. Comparison of the findings of serial audiograms for 6 months and vestibular function tests in patients with ISSNHL and concurrent BPPV with those in age-matched ISSNHL patients without BPPV. Patients with BPPV showed higher PTA averages than those without BPPV on initial and follow-up audiograms. Moreover, the improvement in PTA was less in the BPPV group than in the control. BPPV most commonly involved the posterior canal (17/32, 53.1%), followed by the horizontal canal (8/32, 25%), both the posterior and horizontal canals (6/32, 18.8%), and the anterior canal (1/32, 3.1%). Thirteen (40.6%) of 32 patients had recurrences of BPPV, 9 within a week and another 2 within 3 months. Comorbid BPPV is a negative prognostic indicator of auditory function in ISSNHL. Concurrent BPPV in ISSNHL suggests combined damage to the utricle and may indicate severe and widespread labyrinthine damage, leading to the poor prognosis.</td>

Seven medical assessors, all with clinical experience, from 6 different hospitals, participated in the study. One of them selected the clinical histories of 50 consecutive patients who had consulted as a result of balance disorders (24 men and 26 women) with an average age of 53.5 years. These clinical histories -without any information that would identify the patient, the diagnosis established and the treatment- were sent to another 6 assessors. Each of these investigators established their own diagnosis, trying to adjust it to the epigraphs of the classification. Of the 50 patients, there was substantial agreement as to the diagnosis (4 or more evaluators indicated the same one) in 31 cases (26 with a positive diagnosis and 5 with a negative one, which could not be included in any epigraph). The kappa index, which measures the level of accordance between 2 or more assessors, was 0.4198 (moderate level of agreement). Unanimity was achieved in only 7 cases (4 BPPV, 2 Ménière's disease and 1 vertigo associated with migraine). The current classification, with the criteria it includes, allows labelling with an acceptable consensus to only 62% of the patients. Therefore, a modification in the classification is proposed in relation with the probable BPPV epigraph, as well a revision of the entries for vertigo-migraine and vertigo associated with migraine.</td>

Therefore, the modified Gufoni's manoeuvre shows the same effectiveness in the resolution of symptoms of Gufoni's manoeuvre, but it appears more effective than the latter to reduce the percentage of conversion of the HSC-BPPV into PSC-BPPV (χ(2) = 6.13, P = 0.047).</td>

	<td>To investigate the diagnosis, treatment and therapeutic effect of various types of BPPV. Three hundred and eighteen BPPV patients were retrospectively analyzed. After the types of BPPV were determined by nystagmus characteristics provoked by positioning test, the appropriate repositioning maneuvers were performed. For patients unresponsive to initial treatment, a repetitive treatment was given after seven days. If patients failed after three continuous treatments, other therapeutic methods were chosen and performed. Overall effectiveness in the next three months after treatment was observed. Of 318 patients, 221 (69.5%) with posterior semicircular canal involvement, Epley repositioning maneuver was performed; 62 (19.5%) with horizontal semicircular canal involvement, Barbecue maneuver combined forced prolonged position maneuver were applied; 23 (7.2%) with anterior canal involvement were treated with Epley maneuver; 12 (3.8%) had the mixed type and were treated with corresponding repositioning maneuvers. After one week the total improvement rate was 82.1% (261/318) and 91.8% three months later (292/318). The different BPPV variants can be diagnosed according to the nystagmus characteristics during the appropriate provoking maneuvers, and appropriate repositioning maneuvers is a very effective method which can shorten disease period and relieve the symptoms. The method is easy to apply and could be widely performed clinically.</td>

Patients were randomized into 2 different maneuver sequence groups (n = 113): 2 ST then 1 Ep or 2 Ep then 1 ST. Each group of sequence was randomized into 2 subgroups: with or without postmaneuver restrictions. Vertigo and dizziness were assessed from days 0 to 5 by VAS. There was no difference between vertigo scores between Ep and ST groups. Dizziness scores were higher in Ep group during the first 3 days but became similar to those of ST group at days 4 and 5. ST maneuvers induced liberatory signs more frequently than Ep (58% versus 42% resp., P < 0.01, Fisher's test). After repositioning maneuvers, VAS scores decreased similarly in patients with and without liberatory signs. Postmaneuver restrictions did not influence VAS scores. Even if ST showed a higher rate of liberatory signs than Ep in this series, VAS scores were not influenced by these signs.</td>

	<td>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the time course and frequency patterns of transient low-tone air-bone gaps (ABGs) after canal plugging for intractable BPPV. We investigated eight patients with intractable BPPV who underwent canal plugging. Four were cases with posterior type (pBPPV) and the other four were those with horizontal type (hBPPV). Pure-tone audiometries (PTAs) were performed before and 7 days, 1 month and 6 months after surgery. ABGs (+) were defined as the three-tone-average ≥20dB formulated by (a+b+c)/3, where a, b, and c are ABGs at 0.25, 0.5, and 1kHz, respectively. The ratio of the number of patients with ABGs (+) at the post-operative 7th day and 1st month was 100.0% (8/8). The ratio at the post-operative 6th month was 0.0% (0/8). There were no significant differences in the time course or frequency patterns of the ABGs between pBPPV and hBPPV. We clearly demonstrated eight cases with intractable BPPV showing transient low-tone ABGs during convalescence immediately after canal plugging. During that period, patients also complained of motion-evoked dizziness. All these findings suggest that, during such a convalescence period, the plugged area might not be fixed yet and could still induce the dizziness and low-tone ABGs, as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome and superior semicircular canal deficiency syndrome exhibit low-tone ABGs due to the third mobile inner ear window. More than one month after surgery, both the ABGs and dizziness could disappear according to fixation of the plugged area.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study is to verify the hypothesis that free-floating particles could sometimes localize into the distal portion of the non ampullary arm of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) so that assuming the Dix-Hallpike's positions, the clot could move towards the ampulla eliciting a inhibitory torsional-down beating paroxysmal positional nystagmus (PPNy), instead of typical excitatory torsional-up beating PPNy. Among 45 patients with vestibular signs suggesting anterior semicircular canal paroxysmal positional vertigo (PPV), collected from February 2003 to August 2006, we detected a group of 6 subjects whose clinical findings showed a singular behaviour during follow-up. At the first check-up, all patients were submitted to different types of physical manoeuvres for ASC canalolithiasis. Patients were controlled during the same session and after one week. When we found that nystagmus was qualitatively changed we adopted the appropriate physical therapies for that sign. At a next check-up, after having performed some physical therapies, all patients had a typical PSC PPNy of the opposite side, with respect to that of the ASC initially diagnosed. Basing on these observations we conclude that PSC PPV, similarly to lateral semicircular canal PPV, could manifests in a apogeotropic variant.</td>

This model has not been applied to management of many physical therapy cases, limiting its implementation conceptually into practice as a whole. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the use of the ICF model in the evidence-based management of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. One patient with acute posterior canal canalithiasis benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was treated using the evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis as well as the ICF framework. Repositioning maneuvers and education were provided to ameliorate the relevant body structure and function impairments, activity limitations, and contextual factors related to the patient's overall functioning and disability. The patient demonstrated complete abolishment of her symptoms, both objectively and subjectively after 3 sessions over 4 weeks of care. The physical therapy community has adopted the framework of the ICF because this model has been found to be effective in illustrating the impact of a patient's functional impairments in terms of activity limitations as well as the role that personal and environmental factors play in the patient's overall functioning and disability. When using the ICF in tandem with evidence-based care, patient outcomes have the capability to improve at an even greater rate; however, further research should be completed to discover this potential effect with appropriately designed clinical trials.</td>

	<td>The Vertigo symptom scale (VSS) is a well established tool for the evaluation of vestibular disorders and the associated symptoms of autonomic arousal and somatosensation. By using a validated Malay version of vertigo symptom scale (MVVSS) questionnaire, the severity of the vertigo from patients' perspective can be determined and rated. Before MVVSS can be applied clinically among Malaysians, it was of interest to determine its clinical value in identifying vestibular disorders. Forty normal and 65 PVD subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Normal subjects were recruited amongst Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) staff and students who had no history of ear and vestibular disorders. Mean total score of MVVSS in normal and PVD subjects were 13.9 +/- 11.1 and 30.1 +/- 20.9, respectively. When the total scores of normal and PVD group were compared, the Mann-Whitney U test showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). This is consistent with previous studies. It was also of interest to see if subtypes of PVD [benign paroxymal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, labyrinthitis and unknown] have different MVVSS results. However, analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no significant difference in term of outcomes of MVVSS among the different PVD pathologies. Using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) method, the sensitivity and specificity of MVVSS were 71% and 60%, respectively. MVVSS is able to discriminate clinically among the normal and PVD subjects. However, it is not a good indicator for differential diagnosis of PVD subtypes, at least in this study. Its sensitivity and specificity in clinical diagnosis are reasonably high. Perhaps a bigger sample size would be useful to further study the clinical usefulness of MVVSS.</td>

The efficacy of modified Semont maneuver was superior to the control groups after one week (χ(2) = 14.49, P < 0.01), but there was no difference between the two groups after one month (χ(2) = 0.01, P > 0.05). The efficacy of Brandt-Daroff maneuver was not different with the control group at one week and one month follow-up evaluation (χ(2) = 3.35, P > 0.05;χ(2) = 0.18, P > 0.05). Kaplan-Meier testing showed that the time to recovery was significantly shorter in the modified Epley group. The frequency of side effects was not significantly different among the three physical therapy groups. There was no difference in the frequency of recurrence among the four groups (χ(2) = 4.076, P = 0.253). Duration of illness before self-treatment and age were the independent predictors of recurrence. The modified Epley maneuver is more effective for self treatment of PC-BPPV than modified Semont maneuver and Brandt-Daroff maneuver. Daily routine of self-treatment does not prevent the recurrence of PC-BPPV.</td>

Data of 56 patients with BPVC in vertigo clinic of our hospital from May 2007 to September 2008 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Patients with BPVC were tested with pure tone audiometry, high stimulus rate auditory brainstem response test (ABR), transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), bithermal caloric test, and VEMP. The results of the hearing and vestibular function test were compared and analyzed. There were 56 patients with BPVC, including 32 men, 24 women, aged 3-12 years old, with an average of 6.5 years. Among 56 cases of BPVC patients, the results of pure tone audiometry were all normal. High stimulus rate ABR was abnormal in 66.1% (37/56) of cases. TCD showed 57.1% abnormality in 56 cases, including faster flow rate in 28 cases and slower flow rate in 4 cases. High stimulus rate ABR and TCD were both abnormal in 48.2% (27/56) of cases. Bithermal caloric test was abnormal in 14.3% (8/56) of cases. VEMP showed 32.1% abnormality, including amplitude abnormality in 16 cases and latency abnormality in 2 cases. The abnormal rate of VEMP was much higher than that of caloric test. Vascular mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of BPVC and there is strong evidence for close relationship between BPVC and migraine. High stimulus rate ABR is helpful in the diagnosis of BPVC. The inferior vestibular pathway is much more impaired than the superior vestibular pathway in BPVC.</td>

	<td>Despite being a common disease, data on vertigo management in a real-world setting are scarce. To provide information on the vertigo and its management in a real-world setting. Data were collected from 4,294 patients with vertigo in 13 countries over 28 months via a multi-national, non-interventional observational study (the so-called REVERT registry). Data included medical history and details of anti-vertigo therapy. "Clinical global impression" (CGI) of severity (CGI-S) was assessed at baseline (V1) and then at 6 months follow-up (V2) along with CGI change (CGI-C). All variables were analyzed descriptively. The majority of patients were female, >40 years of age, and almost half had co-morbid cardio-vascular disease. Diagnoses were split into four categories: 37.2% "other vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin," 26.9% benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 20.5% "peripheral vestibular vertigo of unknown origin," and 15.4% Ménière's disease (MD). Betahistine was the most commonly prescribed therapy prior to and after enrollment, and was followed by piracetam, ginkgo biloba, and diuretics. MD had the highest proportion of betahistine treated patients. Almost half of patients were "moderately ill" at V1 based on CGI-S. At V2, patient distribution moved toward "less severe illness" (91.0% improved). The greatest improvements were in the more severely ill, and those with BPPV or "other vertigo of peripheral origin." There was a reduction in illness severity over the course of the study, some of which is likely to be due to pharmacological intervention. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.</td>

This evaluation was also conducted with respect to the entire BPPV population treated with CRPs.

PBPPV patients underwent a twice-a-day self-assessed TBV, using a common low-intensity massaging cushion. Patients were re-tested 1 week later and they were considered free from disease as the results of the positioning tests continued to be negative after 1 month. 70.6 % of PSC PBPPV and 61.9 % of LSC PBPPV patients had positive and statistically significant (P < 0.01) outcomes not biased by "age" and "gender" variables. The recurrence rate of BPPV (RBPPV) was also studied in the BPPV and PBPPV groups after a 12/24-month follow-up and any statistically significant result was found in multiple regression analysis between nuisance variables and RBPPV patients previously treated by CRPs or TBV. The present study suggests that the self-assessed and prolonged TBV could be an alternative treatment in patients affected by PBPPV otherwise addressed to undergo more invasive procedures and pharmacological treatment that are not completely side effects free.</td>

This article reports findings on a patient who had one dysfunctional inner ear and who presented with horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, giving us a relatively pure model for observing nystagmus arising in a subject in whom the affected side is known a priori. It is an interesting human model corroborating theories of nystagmus generation in this pathology and also serves to validate Ewald's second law in a living human subject.</td>

	<td>More than 50% of the patients with peripheral vestibular disorders are suffering from Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Diagnosis is established by positive Dix-Halpike test and/or roll test. Objective of this study was to analyse the delay in diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in current practice and to suggest measures to avoid this delay. One hundred and fifty two consecutive patients who were diagnosed and treated for BPPV in ENT department CMH Rawalpindi from Jan 2009 to Sep 2011 were selected for this study. All these patients were interviewed in detail regarding duration of vertigo, associated symptoms, visits to hospitals, investigations, treatment taken, cost of treatment and last or referral diagnosis before coming to our department. Out of 458 patients who presented with vertigo, 152 (33.2%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of BPPV. Male to female ratio was 1:1.17. Age range was 13-80 years and mean age 58.2 +/- 12.6. Posterior canal was affected in 96.7% and lateral canal in only 3.3%. Average duration between onset of first symptoms and diagnostic positional test was 19 months. One hundred and thirty eight patients have been visiting to general practitioners, various specialists, Homeopaths and Hakeems. Only 21% patients had visited to ENT specialists. 15.2% patients were already labelled correct diagnosis mostly by ENT specialists but Halpike test was done only in 8 patients and Epley's manoeuvre was tried in only four patients. 16.4% patients had undergone costly investigations like CT scan and MRI. Average cost on treatment before final diagnosis was Rs. 13,500 per patient. Particle repositioning procedure was successful in 84% patients in first attempt and 96% in two attempts. Though BPPV is a common and easily treatable condition, its diagnosis and treatment is delayed because of lack of awareness of this condition among doctors and patients. Clear understanding of the patho-physiology, diagnostic positional tests and canalith repositioning manoeuvre should be achieved through lectures and demonstrations.</td>

	<td>In our clinical experience, some of the patients affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) reported the onset of tinnitus shortly before or in association with the positional vertigo. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and the clinical patterns of tinnitus episodes which occurred in association with BPPV and to suggest possible interpretative hypotheses. 171 normal hearing patients affected by BPPV (50 males and 122 females; age range: 25-77 years; mean age 60.3 years ± 14.9) underwent pure tone audiometry, immittance test and a clinical vestibular evaluation before and after repositioning manoeuvers. Those suffering from tinnitus were also assessed using visual analogue scales and tinnitus handicap inventory. 19.3% of the patients reported the appearance of tinnitus concurrently with the onset of the positional vertigo. It was mostly unilateral, localized on the same ear as the BPPV, slight in intensity and intermittent. Tinnitus disappeared or decreased in all patients except two, either spontaneously, before performing the therapeutic manoeuvers, or shortly after. A possible vestibular origin of tinnitus determined by the detachment of macular debris into the ductus reuniens and cochlear duct is discussed.</td>

To evaluate the main symptoms, time to consult for the problem, vertigo characteristics, treatment and follow-up in patients over 70 with BPPV. This was a retrospective cohort study. Four hundred and four patients were diagnosed to have BPPV (between January 2006 and December 2012); 211 of them were ≥70 years old (mean 77.7 years) and 193 <70 years old (mean 53.82 years). Patients over 70 with BPPV took longer to consult for the problem (Spearman rho, p = 0.01). The frequency of a clinical presentation consisting of unsteadiness or imbalance without vertigo sensation is higher among elderly patients (χ(2), p = 10(-6)). The effectiveness of the repositioning maneuver is lower than in patients under 70 (χ(2), p = 0.002), and the recurrences are more frequent (χ(2), p = 0.04). BPPV is a frequent entity in the elderly, and it is necessary to take it into account when older patients complain about imbalance. An appropriate treatment with repositioning maneuvers and prolonged follow-up are required in order to detect recurrences.</td>

	<td>Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood (BPVC) is a common cause of vertigo in children and it is characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo without warning resolving spontaneously after minutes to hours. It has been considered the equivalent of migraine in childhood. Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with BPVC were recruited between 1991 and 1997 with a follow up of at least 15 years. The incidence of migraine, inner ear disorders and family medical history is analyzed. The average age for the onset of the attacks of BPVC was 3 years and 11 months, and for spontaneous resolution, it was around 5 years and 7 months. The average age for follow up was 18 years. Nine patients developed migraine during adulthood. Nineteen of them had a family history of migraine. We have observed that the prevalence of migraine in patients that had been diagnosed with BPVC is higher than in the general population, which leads us to propose BPVC as a precursor of migraine during childhood.</td>

	<td>Despite the high prevalence of vertigo globally and an acknowledged, but under-reported, effect on an individual's wellbeing, few studies have evaluated the burden on healthcare systems and society. This study was aimed to quantitatively determine the impact of vertigo on healthcare resource use and work productivity. The economic burden of vertigo was assessed through a multi-country, non-interventional, observational registry of vertigo patients: the Registry to Evaluate the Burden of Disease in Vertigo. Patients included were those with a new diagnosis of Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, other vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin, or peripheral vestibular vertigo of unknown origin. A total of 4,294 patients at 618 centers in 13 countries were included during the registry. Of the 4,105 patients analyzed, only half were in employment. Among this working patient population, 69.8% had reduced their workload, 63.3% had lost working days, and 4.6% had changed and 5.7% had quit their jobs, due to vertigo symptoms. Use of healthcare services among patients was high. In the 3 months preceding Visit 1, patients used emergency services 0.4 ± 0.9 times, primary care consultations 1.6 ± 1.8 times, and specialist consultations 1.4 ± 2.0 times (all mean ± SD). A mean of 2.0 ± 5.4 days/patient was also spent in hospital due to vertigo. In addition to the negative impact on the patient from a humanistic perspective, vertigo has considerable impact on work productivity and healthcare resource use.</td>

In a prospective study of 50 consecutive cases of orthognathic surgery, we observed that one patient developed BPPV in the postoperative period following bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. The patient was a 23-year-old woman who met the strict criteria for a diagnosis of BPPV, including a positive Dix-Hallpike test.

	<td>We propose to couple the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) to the force coupling method (FCM). The resulting method is an efficient, easy to program, meshless method for flows at low Reynolds numbers with finite-size particles. In such an approach, the flow domain is extended across the solid particle phase, and the flow is approximated by a superposition of singular Stokeslets positioned outside the flow domain and finite-size multipoles collocated with the particle. To improve the efficiency of the coupling, we propose new MFS quadratures for the computation of the volume integrals required for the FCM. These are exact and do not require the expensive evaluation of Stokeslets. The proposed method has been developed in the context of investigations of the fluid dynamics of canalithiasis, that is, a pathological condition of the semicircular canals of the inner ear. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the method.</td>

	<td>This study showed a transient increase of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) amplitudes in the affected ear after successful liberatory maneuvers and no changes in cervical VEMP (cVEMP) amplitudes. These findings support the hypothesis that successful liberatory maneuvers can lead to a repositioning of otoconia to the utricle. To evaluate whether oVEMP amplitudes increase after successful liberatory maneuvers in patients with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (pc-BPPV), while cVEMP amplitudes do not change. These findings may indicate a successful repositioning of dislodged otoconia to the utricular macula, but not to the saccular macula. Thirty patients with unilateral pc-BPPV were prospectively examined with bone-conducted oVEMP and air-conducted cVEMP at four time points: before, after, 1 week after, and 1 month after the liberatory maneuvers (Sémont maneuvers). At the 1-week follow-up, 20 of 30 patients were asymptomatic (responders); BPPV could still be induced in the other 10 (non-responders). In responders the mean n10 amplitude on the affected side increased from 12 ± 6.5 µV at baseline (before the treatment) to 15.9 ± 7.1 µV at 1 week after treatment; this increase was significantly (p = 0.001) higher in responders than in non-responders. cVEMP did not differ significantly.</td>

In the majority of patients with BPPV, the posterior canal is affected by canalolithiasis and there are two highly effective therapeutic maneuvers for treatment.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common cause of disabling vertigo with a high rate of recurrence. Although connections between vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis, as well as between osteoporosis and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo have been suggested respectively in the literature, we are not aware of any publication linking vitamin D and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. As a hypothesis, we suggest that there is a relation between insufficient vitamin D level and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In order to test this hypothesis, in a small retrospective pilot study, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in serum of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and frequency of recurrence after correction of serum level were assessed retrospectively. Patients with idiopathic positional vertigo had a low average serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (23ng/mL) similar to that of the general Austrian population, which has a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. In 4 cases with chronically recurrent severe vertigo episodes, average levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were even significantly lower than in the other vertigo patients, who had their first episode. Vertigo attacks did not recur after supplementation with vitamin D. We raise the possibility that patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who have low vitamin D levels may benefit from supplementation and suggest further epidemiological investigations to determine the effect of correcting vitamin D deficiency on the recurrence of vertigo. Given the many known benefits of vitamin D, the authors recommend the measurement of vitamin D in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and supplementation if necessary.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent vertiginous syndrome. It is caused either by free-floating otoliths in the semicircular canals (canalolithiasis) or by otoconial debris adhering to a canal cupula (cupulolithiasis). The posterior canal is the most frequently involved (80%), while the lateral canal is involved less frequently (15%), and the rarest conditions are anterior canalolithiasis and apogeotropic posterior canalolithiasis (5%). The main diagnostic sign of lateral canal BPPV is paroxysmal horizontal bidirectional positioning nystagmus evoked through Pagnini-McClure's test (head roll in the yaw plane in supine position). In the geotropic variant, which is more frequent, the fast phase of the nystagmus is directed towards the lowermost ear, when the patient lies on the affected side or on the healthy side; in the apogeotropic variant, which is less frequent, the fast phase is directed always toward the uppermost ear, regardless of which side the patient lies on. Paroxysmal nystagmus is more intense on the affected side in the geotropic form, and more intense on the healthy side in the apogeotropic form. The authors describe five cases of another primitive and rare form of lateral BPPV, defined as "direction-fixed paroxysmal nystagmus lateral canal BPPV", which has previously been described by other authors as a transitory step observed during the transformation from an apogeotropic into a geotropic form. It is characterized by typical BPPV symptoms and diagnosed by the presence of a paroxysmal horizontal unidirectional positioning nystagmus, evoked through Pagnini-McClure's test, which is apogeotropic on the affected side and geotropic on the healthy side. In the reported cases, direction-fixed horizontal paroxysmal nystagmus was always transformed into a typical geotropic form. The clinical features and pathophysiology of direction-fixed nystagmus lateral canal BPPV are discussed. </td>

Fifty-three patients with pDBN had a complete otoneurological examination. All subjects, apart from three (excluded from the study), showed no additional neurological signs and normal brain imaging. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: with or without treatment with exercise. Patients were seen again after 24 h, and then weekly for up to 6 months. Forty-seven patients (94%) showed pDBN in the straight head-hanging position and in a Dix-Hallpike position. A torsional component was detected in 17 patients (34%). The mean latency and duration of pDBN was 4.7 ± 5 s and 40.1 ± 22 s, respectively. After 2 weeks, only 12 patients (24%) still had pDBN and all but one patient had recovered by 1 month. Twenty patients (40%) were diagnosed with a typical posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC BPPV) before or after pDBN. This study assessed for the first time the natural course of presumed peripheral pDBN, which was characterized by a spontaneous remission in 24 patients in the first week and in 49 patients within 4 weeks. pDBN is much more common than previously suggested, with about the same frequency as lateral canal BPPV. Furthermore, the clinical characteristics of pDBN have been highlighted, as well as its possible relationship to PC BPPV.</td>

	<td>The pathology of the Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is detected by a clinician through maneuvers consisting of a series of consecutive head turns that trigger the symptoms of vertigo in patient. A statistical model based on a new maneuver has been developed in order to calculate the volume of endolymph displaced after the maneuver. A simplification of the Navier-Stokes problem from the fluids theory has been used to construct the model. In addition, the same cubic splines that are commonly used in kinematic control of robots were used to obtain an appropriate description of the different maneuvers. Then experimental designs were computed to obtain an optimal estimate of the model. D-optimal and c-optimal designs of experiments have been calculated. These experiments consist of a series of specific head turns of duration Δt and angle α that should be performed by the clinician on the patient. The experimental designs obtained indicate the duration and angle of the maneuver to be performed as well as the corresponding proportion of replicates. Thus, in the D-optimal design for 100 experiments, the maneuver consisting of a positive 30° pitch from the upright position, followed by a positive 30° roll, both with a duration of one and a half seconds is repeated 47 times. Then the maneuver with 60° /6° pitch/roll during half a second is repeated 16 times and the maneuver 90° /90° pitch/roll during half a second is repeated 37 times. Other designs with significant differences are computed and compared. A biomechanical model was derived to provide a quantitative basis for the detection of BPPV. The robustness study for the D-optimal design, with respect to the choice of the nominal values of the parameters, shows high efficiencies for small variations and provides a guide to the researcher. Furthermore, c-optimal designs give valuable assistance to check how efficient the D-optimal design is for the estimation of each of the parameters. The experimental designs provided in this paper allow the physician to validate the model. The authors of the paper have held consultations with an ENT consultant in order to align the outline more closely to practical scenarios.</td>

	<td>Vestibular processing is fundamental to our sense of orientation in space which is a core aspect of the representation of the self. Vestibular information is processed in a large subcortical-cortical neural network. Tasks requiring mental rotations of human bodies in space are known to activate neural regions within this network suggesting that vestibular processing is involved in the control of mental rotation. We studied whether mental rotation is impaired in patients suffering from two different forms of unilateral vestibular disorders (vestibular neuritis - VN - and Benign Paroxysmal positional Vertigo - BPPV) with respect to healthy matched controls (C). We used two mental rotation tasks in which participants were required to: (i) mentally rotate their own body in space (egocentric rotation) thus using vestibular processing to a large extent and (ii) mentally rotate human figures (allocentric rotation) thus using own body representations to a smaller degree. Reaction times and accuracy of responses showed that VN and BPPV patients were impaired in both tasks with respect to C. Significantly, the pattern of results was similar in the three groups suggesting that patients were actually performing the mental rotation without using a different strategy from the control individuals. These results show that dysfunctional vestibular inflow impairs mental rotation of both own body and human figures suggesting that unilateral acute disorders of the peripheral vestibular input massively affect the cerebral processes underlying mental rotations. </td>

	<td>To discuss the objective characteristics and mechanism of nystagmus direction, intensity and time in horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV) . A total of 233 patients with HSC-BPPV, whereas 179 horizontal semicircular canalithasis (HSC-Can) and 54 horizontal semicircular cupulolithiasis (HSC-Cup) were involved respectively. The induced nystagmus in roll tests recorded by video-nystagmograph(VNG) , whose direction, intensity and time characteristics were compared in various BPPV. Horizontal nystagmus was both induced by turning left or right in HSC-BPPV roll tests. The direction of the induced nystagmus was the same with turning in HSC-Can. The latency, duration time and intensity ([AKx(-)D] ± s) turning to lesion and normal side were (1.922 ± 1.501)s and (1.447 ± 0.855)s, (25.620 ± 10.409)s, and (22.110 ± 10.931)s, (56.441 ± 33.168)°/s and (24.239 ± 13.892) °/s in HSC-Can. The latency, duration time and intensity turning to lesion side were larger than normal side (t = 3.715, 15.219 and 4.070, P < 0.01) , the difference was statistically significant, and the intensity rate was about 2: 1. The direction of the induced nystagmus was opposite to turning in HSC-Cup. The intensity turning to normal side was larger than lesion side obviously. The intensity rate was about 2: 1, the difference was statistically significant (t = -7.634, P < 0.01) . While the latency and intensity of turning to lesion side in HSC-Can were larger than turn to normal side in HSC-Cup, and the difference detected no statistically significant difference (t = 1.554 and 0.305, P > 0.05). The induced nystagmus intensity of head to two sides in roll tests for HSC-BPPV both follow Ewald's law, and the ratio between stronger and weaker are both 2: 1. These nystagmus parameters of VNG in roll tests are an objective guideline for BPPV diagnosis.</td>

Patients edentulous in maxillary premolar and molar regions with type 3 or 4 bone were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The patients were randomly divided in two groups: in the test group, the implant site was prepared with osteotomes pushed by magnetic mallet, while in the control group, the implant site was performed with osteotomes pressed by hand mallet. Intraoral digital radiographic measurements were reported at 6, 12, and 24 months. Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Eighteen patients (21 women and 15 men) were included in the test group and 18 patients in the control group. The mean patient age was 56.1 years (range 41-71 years). Fifty dental implants were placed. In 10 cases, five in control and five in test group, sinus elevation was performed. After 24 months follow-up, a survival rate of 96.0% was reported. In the control group, two patients claimed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following the use of osteotomes with hand hammer. Marginal bone levels remained stable over time for both groups, and not statistically significant differences were found. After 12 months, the bone height incremented in both groups and, at 24 months, was stable. Statistical analysis reported not statistically significant differences between test and control group. These results demonstrated a stable marginal bone levels over time and a significant increase in bone height between 6 and 12 months in osteotome technique (not sinus elevation). The use of magnetic mallet provided some essential clinical advantages during surgical procedure in comparison with hand mallet.</td>

The patient reported that several years ago, similar symptoms relieved completely after having performed several somersaults together with her granddaughter. This time, repetitive somersaults were again effective to treat her benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Acceleration during a somersault may induce an intracanalicular force strong enough to detach otoconia debris from the cupula. Rolling may then promote their reentrance into the utricle. This case suggests that repetitive somersaults may be an alternative treatment of cupulolithiasis of the horizontal semicircular canal.</td>

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness are common symptoms in the acute care setting and have a wide diagnostic range. The most deleterious diagnosis is vertebrobasilar disease with brain infarction in the posterior fossa. Therefore, every patient with acute vestibular syndrome needs to be evaluated by a structured interview and a systematic physical examination for red flag symptoms which indicate vertebrobasilar infarction. Routinely, the physical examination should cover the head impulse (Halmagyi) test, test for nystagmus as well as the test of skew and in cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The suspicion of a central cause of vertigo is ideally confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Most patients with a peripheral cause of vertigo can be discharged under symptomatic therapy with the advice to consult an ear nose and throat physician while patients with a central cause of vertigo are admitted for further neurological treatment.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is the most common symptom in elderly patients and has been identified as a risk factor for falls. While BPPV is the most common cause of dizziness among elderly, multisensory deficits is the second, with visual, vestibular and proprioceptive reduced function. Asymmetric vestibular function is overrepresented in elderly persons with hip fractures and wrist fractures and can be accessed for screening. In this prospective study with one year observation period, 55 patients (41 women, 14 men), 65 to 90 years old (median 80, interquartile range 11) with multisensory dizziness were included. Headshake test were pathologic in 24 patients, which substantially increased the risk of falls (OR 3.4). Thirteen of the 21 patients who had fallen (p = 0.03), and all 6 patients who sustained three falls or more (p = 0.04), had vestibular asymmetry. No other measure could predict the risk of falls (OR 0.55-1.71). Signs of vestibular asymmetry among elderly with multisensory dizziness could predict falls. Hence, it seems important to address fall-prevention programs to such a group of patients. Simple bedside tests of vestibular asymmetry might be a possibility to screen for one risk factor for falls among elderly.</td>

The forty participants included twenty healthy people and twenty other subjects selected from patients who presented with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo to Audiology Department of Hazrat Rasoul Akram hospital (Tehran, Iran). Assessments comprised of audiological evaluations, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs), recognition of spoken phonemes in white noise (Rsp in wn), and auditory brainstem response to 500 Hz tone burst (ABR(500 HZ)). Twenty affected ears with decreased vestibular excitability as detected by abnormal cVEMPs revealed decreased scores of Rsp in wn and abnormal findings of ABR(500 HZ). Both unaffected and normal ears had normal results. Multiple comparisons of mean values of cVEMPs and ABR(500 HZ) between three groups were significant (P < 0.05, ANOVA). The correlation between RSP in wn and p13 latencies was significant. The peak-to-peak amplitudes showed significant correlation to RSP in wn. The correlation between RSP in wn and the latencies of n23 was significant. In high-level of noisy competing situations, healthy human saccular sensation can mediate the detection of low frequencies and possibly help in cochlear hearing for frequency and intensity discrimination. So, all human hearing is not cochlear.</td>

	<td>Purpose. It has been assumed that postirradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients are prone to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The purpose of this study was to better understand this clinical entity. Materials and Methods. From September 2003 to June 2011, we conducted a retrospective study of 11 irradiated NPC patients with BPPV in our institute. During the same period, 11 irradiated NPC patients without BPPV were randomly selected and enrolled as the control group. All medical records of these patients were evaluated. Results. The risk of BPPV rises significantly when the patient undergoes radiotherapy (RT) twice and the threshold radiation dose is >120 Gy (P = 0.027). The occurrence of postirradiated BPPV was significantly related to incidences of otitis media and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (P = 0.011 and 0.009, resp.). All the patients responded well to repositioning maneuvers. Conclusion. A second course of RT, postirradiated otitis media, or SNHL is associated with the potential risk of radiation-induced BPPV. Repositioning maneuvers were safe and effective for relief of this disease. </td>

Aim This study aims to characterize vector electronystagmography tests in the elderly participants in a service station of the Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (SUS) in the city of Natal, who presented with dizziness. Methods A cross-sectional and clinical study to characterize the vector electronystagmography in 10 members of an elderly SUS referral center located in the city of Natal with dizziness. Results Of 10 patients interviewed, 9 were women, and just 1 was a man. All complained of dizziness in the last year, and most of them had more than one type of dizziness. The main differential diagnosis was benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Regarding vector electronystagmography, we found 20% of patients with semispontaneous nystagmus in at least one direction and changes in saccades latency in 100% of patients, with 20% in relation to the accuracy of pendular tracking changes at the frequency of 0.2 Hz, 10% at 0.4 Hz, and 80% at 0.8 Hz, and 10% change in optokinetic gain. No patient had altered caloric test. Conclusion Vector electronystagmography alterations in the elderly do not always indicate disease. </td>

	<td>Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms following minor head trauma. Although these symptoms resolve within a few weeks in many patients, in some the symptoms may last much longer and impede ability to return to work and full functioning. Causes of persisting or recurrent dizziness may include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, so-called labyrinthine concussion, unilateral vestibular nerve injury or damage to the utricle or saccule, perilymphatic fistula, or less commonly traumatic endolymphatic hydrops. Some dizziness after head trauma is due to nonlabyrinthine causes that may be related to structural or microstructural central nervous system injury or to more complicated interactions between migraine, generalized anxiety, and issues related to patients self-perception, predisposing psychological states, and environmental and stress-related factors. In this article, the authors review both the inner ear causes of dizziness after concussion and also the current understanding of chronic postconcussive dizziness when no peripheral vestibular cause can be identified. </td>

The childhood periodic syndromes include benign paroxysmal torticollis, benign paroxysmal vertigo, abdominal migraine, and cyclic vomiting syndrome. Recent research suggests infant colic may also fit into this category. Migraine headache is common in children and adolescents, and chronic migraine effects 0.8-1.8% of adolescents and 0.6% of children. Two triptans are now FDA-approved for the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. For preventive therapy, a number of medications have been studied and a major national trial is ongoing. Childhood periodic syndromes are thought to be early life expressions of those genes that later in life are expressed as migraine headache. Future research into mechanisms of identifying children with these disorders prior to extensive and often invasive testing would be of benefit to these families and children. Migraine-specific therapies are now approved for the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Preventive migraine therapy is indicated in appropriate patients, although which medications are most effective in children is an area of active research.</td>

It is generally believed that BPPV is due to the dislodged otoconial particles from otolith organs and unusual collection of them within any of semicircular canals or even in all three semicircular canals. Although the typical features of nystagmus in BPPV have been well-studied, very few studies (just four articles) have highlighted the presence of spontaneous nystagmus in BPPV recently. During the past 10 years, 2850 patients have been examined at the audiology unit of our department, and 254 patients have received diagnoses of BPPV but recently 2 patients presented with BPPV and spontaneous nystagmus, a new symptom that has been never observed in our clinical records. We herein describe this rare symptom in 2 case of BPPV. A 50-year-old woman with BPPV who showed an 18 degree spontaneous nystagmus treated with Epley maneuver and a 53-year-old man with 3 degree spontaneous nystagmus. </td>

	<td>To explore the effective of the new mechanical assistant canalith repositioning procedure (TRV-CRP) to the diagnosis and treatment of the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The data of the cases with suspected diagnosis of BPPV from April to June of 2012 checked and treated by TRV-CRP in our vestibular function checking room were collected and analyzed. All of the cases were followed up to one to three months. Total 504 cases of suspected diagnosis of BPPV were collected. Three cases were rejected for un completed procedure. All of the 501 completed procedure cases included 162 male and 339 female with age ranging from 10 years old to 86 years old (52. 8 +/- 14 years old). 169 cases (33.73%) were positive diagnosis and 332 cases were negative diagnosis (66.27%). 135 cases enrolled only one semicircular canal (SC) account for 79.89% of all the positive diagnosis that included 17 cases of left horizontal SC, 4 cases of left superior SC, 29 cases of left posterior SC, 23 cases of right horizontal SC, 4 cases of superior SC and 58 cases of right posterior SC. 25 cases enrolled more than two SC (14.80%). 9 cases of objective BPPV (5.33%) included 5 cases of right posterior SC, 3 cases of left posterior SC and one cases of right horizontal SC. Exception of 163 cases without classic BPPV history in the 332 negative diagnosis cases, 169 cases had classic BPPV history including 14 cases treated by manual canalith repositioning procedure and 33 cases which had released from the vertigo. The rate of treatment effective by TRV-CRP was 100%. There were 20 cases returned for retreatment because their unsatisfied about the release of their symptom but proved to be negative diagnosis again in 10 cases and positive diagnosis in 10 cases, however, only 4 cases proved to be the same SC disease were considered as relapse (2.37%) and others enrolled different SC. After retreated, all cases got release without relapse. TRV-CRP could diagnosis 34% of the primary diagnosis cases of BPPV. TRV-CRP had high rate of effective and lower relapse which especially fitted to patients suffered from complex BPPV or difficult to finish the manual repositioning procedure. However, due to the expensive of TRV-CRP, it is reasonable to combine TRV-CRP and manual repositioning procedure in clinical.</td>

	<td>This review examines the research from 2011 through 2012 on treatment efficacy in two common vestibular disorders - vestibular hypofunction and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Significant numbers of randomized controlled trials now support the use of specific exercises for the treatment of patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. We do not know if some treatment approaches are more effective than others. There is preliminary evidence that head movement may be the component critical to recovered function and decreased symptoms. Some patient characteristics and initial assessment results appear to predict treatment outcome but the evidence is incomplete. Treatment of posterior canal BPPV canalithiasis is well established. New evidence supports certain treatments for horizontal canal BPPV. Treatments for unilateral vestibular hypofunction and for posterior canal BPPV are effective; however, there are many as yet unanswered questions such as why some patients with vestibular hypofunction do not improve with a course of vestibular exercises. We also do not know what would be the best treatment for anterior canal BPPV or for multiple-canal involvement BPPV.</td>

	<td>Care of patients with vestibular symptoms focuses primarily on physical otoneurologic disorders; however, psychological factors can sustain symptoms, confound assessment, and adversely affect treatment. Health anxiety is a particularly pernicious process that simultaneously magnifies physical symptoms and inhibits medical care. To demonstrate the excess morbidity caused by vestibular health anxiety and its successful management in a patient with otoneurologic disease. Report of a 41-year-old woman with recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, and chronic subjective dizziness, who expressed grave concerns about her health, repeatedly questioned her otoneurologic diagnoses, and failed physical therapy and medication treatment until her health anxiety and otoneurologic illnesses were addressed simultaneously. Health anxiety is an empirically validated concept that explains troublesome health-related beliefs and behaviors. It is frustrating for patients and health care teams, but can be treated successfully in otoneurology practice, thereby reducing physical symptoms, emotional distress, functional impairment, and health care overutilization.</td>

	<td>Thirteen (5.4%) of patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Most of the patients showed profound hearing loss and had BPPV of the lateral canal. BPPV in patients with ISSNHL may have no influence on hearing recovery. BPPV occurs in 8.6-12.7% of patients with ISSNHL; however, the role of BPPV in hearing recovery remains controversial. Therefore, we investigated hearing outcomes in the patients, including the distribution of initial hearing threshold, the type of canal involved, and the number of repositioning maneuvers performed. Of 241 patients with ISSNHL who presented to a dizziness clinic between March 2008 and May 2012, 13 with both ISSNHL and BPPV were recruited for this study. The patients were evaluated for their initial hearing threshold, type of canal involved, response to repositioning maneuvers, and hearing outcome. Age- and hearing threshold-matched patients with ISSNHL but without BPPV were randomly sampled and included for a hearing outcome comparison. Of 13 patients with ISSNHL and BPPV, 11 showed profound hearing loss. The lateral canal was involved in 11 patients, including 3 who had multi-canal involvement. Ten patients underwent a single repositioning maneuver. Those patients did not display a significant difference in hearing recovery compared with those patients having ISSNHL only.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in adults and is a result of otolithic particles or debris that become free floating within a semicircular canal or adhere to the cupula. Characteristics of BPPV include brief episodes of latent onset vertigo that occur with changes in head position, transient rotary nystagmus beating toward the dependent ear, and reversed nystagmus upon sitting up. Both the vertigo and nystagmus fatigue quickly while maintaining the same head position. The BPPV may be classified as objective or subjective. Objective BPPV presents all the aforementioned symptoms whereas subjective BPPV presents all the symptoms without nystagmus. The accepted method of treatment for objective BPPV is canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRM); however, CRM are not traditionally used as the method of treatment for cases of subjective BPPV. The purpose of the study was to determine if the subjective report of dizziness using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) was different in patients with objective and subjective BPPV and to determine if the two groups showed similar improvements in perceived dizziness handicap following CRM treatment. The present study utilized a retrospective, repeated measures design. Sixty-three adults with BPPV that were given the DHI both before and after CRM treatment. Pre and post DHI results were analyzed for participants with objective versus subjective BPPV. A five-question DHI subscale was also analyzed between the groups. A significant difference was noted between initial and posttreatment DHI scores for patients in both the subjective and objective groups when using the full-scale and subscale DHI. No significant difference was noted between groups for their initial or posttreatment DHI scores. The two groups also did not differ significantly in their initial or posttreatment DHI subscale scores. The results of the study indicated that individuals with both objective and subjective BPPV demonstrated significant improvement in DHI scores following CRM treatment. Additionally, there was no difference in DHI improvement for the subjective versus objective group suggesting CRM are effective for both subjective BPPV and objective BPPV. This improvement in DHI scores was also noted in the five-question DHI subscale with no significant difference noted between groups. These findings combined with previous studies suggest the presence or absence of nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike maneuvers is not related to the effectiveness of treatment using CRM.</td>

	<td>Background and aim A diagnosis of chronic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is based on brief attacks of rotatory vertigo and concomitant nystagmus elicited by rapid changes in head position relative to gravity. However, the clinical course of BPPV may vary considerably from a self-limiting to a persisting and/or recurrent disabling problem. The authors' experience is that the most common complaints of patients with chronic BPPV are nautical vertigo or dizziness with other symptoms including neck pain, headache, widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and visual disturbances. Trauma is believed to be the major cause of BPPV in individuals younger than fifty years. Chronic BPPV is associated with high morbidity. Since these patients often suffer from pain and do not have rotatory vertigo, their symptoms are often attributed to other conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between these symptoms and chronic BPPV. Methods During 2010 a consecutive prospective cohort observational study was performed. Diagnostic criteria: (A) BPPV diagnosis confirmed by the following: (1) a specific history of vertigo/dizziness evoked by acceleration/deceleration, (2) nystagmus in the first position of otolith repositioning maneuvers, and (3) appearing and disappearing nystagmus during the repositioning maneuvers; (B) the disorder has persisted for at least six months. (C) Normal MRI of the cerebrum. (A) Any disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), (B) migraine, (C) active Ménière's disease, and (D) severe eye disorders. Symptom questionnaire ('yes or no' answers during a personal interview) and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) were used. Results We included 69 patients (20 males and 49 females) with a median age of 45 years (range 21-68 years). The median duration of the disease was five years and three months. The video-oculography confirmed BPPV in more than one semicircular canal in all patients. In 15% there was a latency of more than 1 min before nystagmus occurred. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) median score was 55.5 (score >60 indicates a risk of fall). Seventy-five percent were on 50-100% sick leave. Eighty-one percent had a history of head or neck trauma. Nineteen percent could not recall any history of trauma. In our cohort, nautical vertigo and dizziness (81%) was far more common than rotatory vertigo (20%). The majority of patients (87%) reported pain as a major symptom: neck pain (87%), headache (75%) and widespread pain (40%). Fatigue (85%), visual disturbances (84%), and decreased concentration ability (81%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. In addition, unexpected findings such as involuntary movements of the extremities, face, neck or torso were found during otolith repositioning maneuvers (12%). We describe one case, as an example, how treatment of his BPPV also resolved his chronic, severe pain condition. Conclusion This observational study demonstrates a likely connection between chronic BPPV and the following symptoms: nautical vertigo/dizziness, neck pain, headache, widespread pain, fatigue, visual disturbances, cognitive dysfunctions, nausea, and tinnitus. Implications Patients with complex pain conditions associated with nautical vertigo and dizziness should be evaluated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)-questionnaire which can identify treatable balance disorders in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.</td>

	<td>The purpose of this study is to define the diagnostic criteria for anterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) based on clinical data and the available anatomical and pathophysiological data. Between July 2006 and June 2007, 4320 patients consulting for otoneurological disease were investigated by otological examination, videonystagmography and neurological examination. BPPV was diagnosed in 1430 patients, involving the posterior semicircular canal in 1325 patients, the horizontal semicircular canal in 85 patients, the posterior semicircular canal and ipsilateral anterior (superior) semicircular canal in 19 patients and the anterior semicircular canal only in one patient. In the 20 patients with anterior semicircular canal BPPV, the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test induced ageotropic horizontal torsional nystagmus beating towards the uppermost ear in the lateral supine position with reversal on standing. The modified Epley manoeuvre was effective in 94.1% of cases on the 8th day and in 97.5% of cases at 1 month. Nystagmus beating towards the uppermost ear on the DH test is consistent with BPPV involving the anterior semicircular canal of the uppermost ear. The torsional component of nystagmus and not just the vertical component must be taken into account to facilitate the diagnosis with videonystagmoscopy glasses and identify the affected side. The anterior semicircular canal is rarely affected due to its anatomical position. Settling of otoconia in this canal requires hyperextension of the head. Treatment is simple, consisting of the modified Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre.</td>

	<td>Dizziness-vertigo is common in adults, but clinical providers may rarely diagnose vestibular impairment and referral could be delayed. To assess neurotology symptoms (including triggers) reported by patients with peripheral vestibular disease, during the year just before their referral to vestibular evaluation. 282 patients with peripheral vestibular disease and 282 control subjects accepted to participate. They had no middle ear, retinal, neurological, psychiatric, autoimmune or autonomic disorders. They reported their symptoms by a standardized questionnaire along with their anxiety/depression symptoms. Patients were referred after months or years from the onset of their symptoms, 24% of them reported frequent falls with a long clinical evolution; 10% of them reported no vertigo but instability related to specific triggers; 86% patients and 12% control subjects reported instability when moving the head rapidly and 79% patients and 6% control subjects reported instability when changing posture. Seven out of the 9 symptoms explored by the questionnaire allowed the correct classification of circa 95% of the participants (Discriminant function analysis, p < 0.001). High blood pressure, dyslipidemia and anxiety/depression symptoms showed a mild correlation with the total score of symptoms (multiple R2 =0.18, p < 0.001). Late referral to vestibular evaluation may underlie a history of frequent falls; some patients may not report vertigo, but instability related to specific triggers, which could be useful to prompt vestibular evaluation. High blood pressure, dyslipidemia and anxiety/depression symptoms may have a mild influence on the report of symptoms of vestibular disease in both, patients and control subjects.</td>

	<td>Orthostatic dizziness (OD) and positional dizziness (PD) are considerably common conditions in dizziness clinic, whereas those two conditions are not clearly separated. We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of simple OD and OD combined with PD for the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and orthostatic intolerance (OI). Patients presenting with OD (n=102) were divided into two groups according to their symptoms: group PO, presenting with PD as well as OD; group O, presenting with OD. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and vestibular function tests were performed to identify the etiology of the dizziness. Orthostatic vital sign measurement (OVSM) was used to diagnose OI. The majority of patients were in group PO (87.3%). BPPV was the most common cause of OD for entire patients (36.3%) and group PO (37.1%), while OI was most common etiology for group O (38.5%). Total of 17 (16.7%) OI patients were identified by OVSM test. Orthostatic hypotension (n=10) was most frequently found, followed by orthostatic hypertension (n=5), and orthostatic tachycardia (n=2). Group O showed significantly higher percentage (38.5%) of OI than group PO (13.5%) (P=0.039). It is suggested that orthostatic testing such as OVSM or head-up tilt table test should be performed as an initial work up for the patients with simple OD. Positional tests for BPPV should be considered as an essential diagnostic test for patients with OD, even though their dizziness is not associated with PD.</td>

	<td>Previous studies have demonstrated an association of osteopenia/osteoporosis with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Since vitamin D takes part in the regulation of calcium and phosphorus found in the body and plays an important role in maintaining proper bone structure, decreased bone mineral density in patients with BPPV may be related to decreased serum vitamin D. We measured the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 100 patients (63 women and 37 men, mean age ± SD = 61.8 ± 11.6) with idiopathic BPPV and compared the data with those of 192 controls (101 women and 91 men, mean age ± SD = 60.3 ± 11.3) who had lived in the same community without dizziness or imbalance during the preceding year. The selection of the controls and acquisition of clinical information were done using the data from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2008. The serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was lower in the patients with BPPV than in the controls (mean ± SD = 14.4 ± 8.4 versus 19.1 ± 6.8 ng/ml, p = 0.001). Furthermore, patients with BPPV showed a higher prevalence of decreased serum vitamin D (<20 ng/ml, 80.0 vs. 60.1 %, p < 0.001) than the controls. Multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria, regular exercise and the existence of decreased bone mineral density demonstrated that vitamin D insufficiency (10-20 ng/ml) and deficiency (<10 ng/ml) were associated with BPPV with the odds ratios of 3.8 (95 % confidence interval = 1.51-9.38, p = 0.004) and 23.0 (95 % confidence interval = 6.88-77.05, p < 0.001).

	<td>Vertigo or dizziness is primarily caused by peripheral vestibular disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vestibular neuritis. BPPV can be diagnosed from associated positional torsional or direction-changing horizontal nystagmus and can be treated with canalith repositioning procedures. In contrast, vestibular neuritis and other acute peripheral vestibulopathies can be diagnosed from associated unidirectional horizontal nystagmus. Evaluation of nystagmus is essential for the diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders. Vertigo/dizziness caused by disorders in the brainstem or upper cerebellum is usually associated with other neurological signs or symptoms, such as motor palsy, sensory deficit, dysarthria, ocular motor palsy, and limb ataxia. In contrast, vertigo/dizziness caused by disorders in the lower cerebellum is not associated with these signs or symptoms; however, truncal ataxia becomes apparent in a standing position. Small lesions in the lower cerebellum can rarely cause unidirectional horizontal nystagmus directed toward the side of the lesions or direction-changing apogeotropic positional nystagmus; both types of nystagmus are enhanced when a patient lies on the non-affected side. This positional enhancement suggests that the same pathogenetic mechanism is involved in both types of nystagmus. The cerebellar lesions may disinhibit both semicircular-ocular and otolith-ocular reflexes. Semicircular-ocular reflex-dominant disinhibitions may result in the ipsilateral horizontal nystagmus, whereas otolith-ocular reflex-dominant disinhibitions may result in the direction-changing apogeotropic positional nystagmus.</td>

Pathological nystagmus appears or strengthens usually during change in head position. Therefore, dizziness or nystagmus associated with head movements is not specific to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo unless it is verified in specific positional test. Peripheral nystagmus decelerates during visual fixation, accelerates when gaze is turned towards the fast phase, does not change direction, and is usually composed of several directional components unlike central nystagmus. The velocity and frequency of the slow phase of nystagmus can be measured with electronystagmography or video-oculography.</td>

	<td>To examine whether shaking the head during the DH exam (HSDH) may improve diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (pBPPV) in patients with a negative Dix-Hallpike (DH) examination. A prospective cohort clinical study on consecutive patients with dizziness, who were seen by 2 experienced neurotologists. Patients underwent a complete neurotology examination, including positioning testing with roll test and DH. Patients with a negative DH underwent a HSDH. Patients with a positive DH (Group 1) or only with a positive HSDH (Group 2) underwent a particle reposition maneuver (PRM), which was a modification of the Epley maneuver. Variables including sex, age, the duration of symptoms until diagnosis, and the number of visits required until cure were examined in each group. A tertiary dizziness clinic and in 2 private clinics. All patients diagnosed with pBPPV. DH test after head shaking and comparison of variables between the 2 study groups. Sixty nine patients were diagnosed with pBPPV (Group 1). Twelve additional patients were negative on DH but were found positive on HSDH (Group 2), improving the diagnostic yield by 14.8%. There was no statistical relation between the 2 groups and the variables examined; however, there was a trend for longer duration of symptoms (44.3 versus 64 d) and less visits until cure (1.5 versus 1.7 visits) in Group 2. Patients with a negative DH should undergo a HSDH. Patients only diagnosed as pBPPV by a positive HSDH may represent a subgroup with a milder form of disease.</td>

	<td>A common cause of dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), is effectively diagnosed and cured with the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT) and the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM). We aimed to describe the use of these processes in emergency departments (EDs), assess for trends in use over time, and determine provider level variability in use. Prospective population-based surveillance study. Emergency departments in Nueces County, Texas, from January 15, 2008, to January 14, 2011. Adult patients discharged from EDs with dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance documented at triage. Clinical information was abstracted from source documents. A hierarchical logistic regression model adjusting for patient and provider characteristics was used to estimate trends in DHT use and provider-level variability. A total of 3522 visits for dizziness were identified. A DHT was documented in 137 visits (3.9%). A CRM was documented in 8 visits (0.2%). Among patients diagnosed with BPPV, a DHT was documented in only 21.8% (34 of 156) and a CRM in 3.9% (6 of 156). In the hierarchical model (c-statistic = 0.93), DHT was less likely to be used over time (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-0.99), and the provider level explained 50% (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.50) of the variance in the probability of DHT use. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is seldom examined for and, when diagnosed, infrequently treated in this ED population. Use of the DHT is decreasing over time and varies substantially by provider. Implementation research focused on BPPV care may be an opportunity to optimize management in ED dizziness presentations.</td>

A prospective, cohort, screening study. A community-based hospital located in a small midwestern city with a greater metropolitan population of approximately 125,000. One hundred ninety-eight young adults (99 men and 99 women), ages 18-34 years and not being treated for dizziness or balance problems, were recruited from November 2009 to April 2010. The participants completed questionnaires that detailed demographics, medical and surgical history, sports and/or activity participation history, and baseline symptoms commonly associated with BPPV. The participants were screened for inclusion with an ocular motor assessment in room light, followed by a vestibular positional assessment for BPPV with infrared camera-equipped goggles recorded on digital video disk. The prevalence of BPPV, defined as PIN, along with symptoms in study participants. The prevalence of BPPV was 9% in this young adult population. Symptoms during testing were reported in 14% of all subjects (22% of women, 5% of men). Of 22 women who reported symptoms, 12 had PIN (P = .519), whereas the 5 men who reported symptoms all had PIN (P = .001). PIN, characteristic of that seen in BPPV (with or without associated symptoms), was identified in 53% of subjects, with 43% of subjects having posterior canal involvement, 10% having anterior canal involvement, and 8% having horizontal canal involvement. Eleven percent of subjects had bilateral semicircular canal involvement. Nine percent of our young adult subjects were diagnosed with previously unrecognized BPPV, with provoked symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, or imbalance, symptoms that may cause significant physical and psychosocial limitations if left untreated. This is an important finding because BPPV is an often-overlooked diagnosis that has a known, very effective treatment.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo of labyrinthine origin and usually idiopathic. However, 15-20% of all cases occur after trauma to the head, and it has rarely been reported after maxillofacial surgery, so to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of its bilateral occurrence after orthognathic surgery. It resolves slowly, but symptoms are incapacitating. It can be diagnosed from the history and physical examination, including the Dix-Hallpike test. Maxillofacial surgeons should be aware of it in patients who complain of dizziness after orthognathic surgery, and should know how to manage it properly. </td>

Both patients had neither preexisting ear disease nor vertigo before the surgery. All the examinations were normal. With Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which is the criterion-standard test, the characteristic nystagmus was observed. Right posterior canal BPPV was diagnosed, and they were both treated with Epley canalith repositioning maneuver. Publications related to postsurgical vertigo are available in literature, but it is still an underdiagnosed disorder. We would like to mention about this rare entity and inform the surgeons that they must keep in mind that a patient who is complaining about vertigo or dizziness after the surgery should be observed and investigated for BPPV.</td>

	<td>Migraine equivalents are the most common cause of vertigo in children and adolescents. Vertigo and balance disorders occur frequently in children during the course of otitis media, middle ear effusion and viral infections. If otitis media is associated with reduced hearing and vertigo, labyrinthitis must be considered. Craniocerebral injury is another important cause of vertigo in children. In contrast, spontaneous benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is rare among children. The isolated cases of endolymphatic hydrops that occur in children are usually secondary. Perilymph fistula can have congenital, infectious or trauma-related causes. The following characteristics are useful for differentiating between different vertiginous syndromes: type and duration of vertigo, triggering/aggravating/alleviating factors and accompanying symptoms. A neuro-ophthalmologic examination is essential to rule out central vestibular disorders. </td>

Therefore, we can infer that VEMP abnormality is one of risk factors for BPPV recurrence. This prospective study aimed to test the hypothesis that otolith dysfunction using the VEMP test is a cause of recurrence of BPPV. cVEMP and oVEMP tests using 500 Hz tone-burst stimuli were performed on 16 patients with recurrent BPPV between March 2010 and December 2011. Both VEMP tests were performed in 20 patients with non-recurrent BPPV. The differences in age, sex, and involved canal between the recurrent and non-recurrent BPPV groups were not significant. Abnormal cVEMP responses were detected in 5 of 16 (31.3%) subjects in the recurrent BPPV group and abnormal oVMEP responses were detected in 4 of 16 (25%) subjects in the recurrent BPPV group. When we defined VEMP abnormality as an abnormal cVEMP or abnormal oVEMP, VEMP abnormalities were detected in eight (50%) subjects in the recurrent BPPV group and in three (15%) subjects in the non-recurrent BPPV group; the difference between groups was significant.</td>

	<td>The necessity of postural restriction to patients suffering from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is controversial. To investigate the impact of the sleep position after the repositioning maneuver on BPPV recurrence. 150 unilateral BPPV patients who were treated by repositioning maneuver were distributed into two groups. The patients in group A were instructed to sleep in a semi-sitting position at an angle of approximately 30 degrees and refrain from sleeping on their BPPV affected side for one week. The patients in group B were told to sleep in any preferred position. The comparison of recurrence rates according to different actual sleep positions in one week and one month was performed. There was a statistically significant correlation between the sleeping side and the side affected by BPPV. Without instructions on postural restriction, most patients (82.9%, 73/88) avoided sleeping on their affected side. The patients sleeping on their affected side had a higher recurrence rate (35.3%) than ones sleeping in other positions in the first week after the repositioning maneuver (p<0.05, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test). The patients sleeping randomly in following 3 weeks had a lower recurrence rate than ones sleeping in other position (p<0.05, Fisher's exact test). BPPV patients had a poor compliance to postural instructions. The habitual sleep side was associated with the side affected by BPPV. The patients sleeping on their affected side had a higher recurrence rate than those sleeping in other positions in first week after the repositioning maneuver.</td>

A total of 122 patients with HSC-BPPV performed both the 90- and 180-degree SRTs. The affected side was determined by the 90- and 180-degree SRTs. The bow and lean (BL) test was also performed in cases with ambiguous or opposite results on both SRTs. A comparison of the difference in slow phase velocity (SPV) of nystagmus among the 90- and 180-degree SRTs and BL test. The maximum SPV of nystagmus during the 180-degree SRT was significantly greater than that during the 90-degree SRT. The SPV difference was less in the 180-degree SRT than that in the 90-degree SRT. Although the 180-degree SRT showed fewer meaningful results (n = 65) than the 90-degree SRT (n = 71), the affected side was determined by the 180-degree SRT in 15 cases with ambiguous results on the 90-degree SRT. Among 10 cases showing opposite results, 7 were identified by the BL test. Five (71.4%) of 7 cases had consistent affected sides with the 180-degree SRT.

	<td>There are reports of an association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and hyperuricemia. We sought to determine the risk of vertigo among patients with gout compared with the general population, using a nationwide Taiwanese population-based claims database. Our study cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of gout disorders in 2004 (N = 18773). Four age- and gender-matched controls for every patient in the study cohort were selected using random sampling as the comparison cohort (N = 75092). All subjects were followed from the date of cohort entry until they developed vertigo or to the end of 2006. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to evaluate the 3-year vertigo-free survival rates. Of the total sample, 2563 (incidence, 10.09 per 1000 person-years) had vertigo during the 3-year follow-up period: 570 (incidence, 11.78 per 1000 person-years) from the study cohort and 1993 (incidence, 9.69 per 1000 person-years) from the comparison cohort. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of peripheral and central vertigo in patients with gout compared with controls during the 2-3-year follow-up were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.29, p = 0.003) and 1.08 (95% CI = 0.86-1.36, p = 0.53), respectively. This is the first population-based study performed to suggest that patients with gout may have an increased risk of peripheral vertigo but not central vertigo. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo may be the reason for the observed association; however, future studies are required to further ascertain the relationship between gout and the various causes of peripheral vertigo.</td>

Electrophysiological and video-oculographic testing; vestibular rehabilitation. Cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs); video head impulse testing. The video head-impulse test revealed an eye velocity cutoff at 80°/s in the time interval from 40 to 90 ms after initiation of head impulses to the right. This normalized within 2 days after liberatory maneuvers, documenting for the first time a reversible deficiency of the cupular-endolymph high-frequency system dynamics. Cervical and ocular vestibular myogenic potentials were absent during stimulation of the affected side before the liberatory maneuvers but normalized within 30 to 80 days. This case is special in 4 respects: 1) nystagmus intensity, but not direction, was dependent on head orientation with respect to gravity, indicating a horizontal canal plug; 2) VEMPs were asymmetrical before liberatory maneuvers; 3) VEMPs recovered after Day 30; and 4) video head-impulse test asymmetry recovered. These observations challenge the common belief that VEMPs are evoked by otolith stimulation only. Instead, the assumption of a reversible canal dysfunction by a plug offers a more plausible explanation for all effects.</td>

	<td>This study investigated the relationships between morphological changes in the vestibular aqueduct (VA) in different inner ear pathologies. Eighty-eight patients (34 males and 54 females, ranging from seven to 88 years of age; average age 49.2 years) with cochleovestibular disorders underwent temporal bone CT (with a 64-channel helical CT system according to temporal bone protocol parameters; 0.6 mm slice thickness, 0.6 mm collimation, bone reconstruction algorithm). All patients with cochleovestibular disorders who underwent temporal bone CT had been previously divided into six different suspected clinical classes: A) suspected pathology of the third window; B) suspected retrocochlear hearing loss; C) defined Ménière's disease; D) labyrinth lithiasis; E) recurrent vertigo. On CT images we analyzed the length, width and morphology of the VA, contact between the VA and the jugular bulb (JB), the thickness of the osseous capsule covering the semicircular canals, the pneumatization rate of the temporal bone and the diameter of the internal auditory canal. At the end of the diagnostic work-up all patients were grouped into six pathological classes, represented as follow: 1) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 2) recurrent vertigo (RV), 3) enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS), 4) sudden or progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), 5) superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCD), 6) recurrent vestibulocochlear symptoms in Ménière's disease. We evaluated 176 temporal bones in 88 patients. The VA was clearly visualized in 166/176 temporal bones; in ten ears the VA was not visualized. In 14 ears (11 patients, in three of whom bilaterally) we found an enlarged VA while in 31 ears the VA was significantly narrower. In 16 ears a dehiscence of the JB with the vestibular or cochlear aqueduct was noted. In all six patients with suspected EVAS we found a AV wider than 1.5 mm on CT scans; moreover CT identified four patients with large VA and ill-defined clinical symptoms. Most patients with BPPV (11 patients, Class 1) we did not find any VA abnormalities on CT scans, confirming the clinical diagnosis in ten patients; in the remaining patients we found an enlarged VA, not clinically suspected. In the RV class (eight patients, Class 2) we found three patients with negative CT scans, two patients with narrow aqueduct and subsequently reclassified as Ménière's disease patients, and three patients with ectasic JB dehiscence with the VA. In patients suffering from SNHL we found no statistically significant correlation with the morphological abnormalities. The clinical suspicion of SSCD was confirmed by CT in 11/13 patients (84.6 %); in addition another seven patients showed a thinning or dehiscence of the superior semicircular canals as the prevailing alteration on CT scans, and were reclassified in this group. Ménière's disease symptoms were correlated with a VA alteration in more than half of the cases; the most striking finding in this class was that the VA was significantly narrower (21 patients). Our study demonstrates that alterations of the VA morphology are not only related to EVAS but are also found in other inner ear pathologies such as Ménière's disease. Furthermore, MDCT may confirm the presence of correlations between the morphology of inner ear structures such as VA, semicircular canals or JB dehiscence, and alterations of vestibulocochlear function. </td>

	<td>The need for class I and II studies on the efficacy of liberatory maneuvers in the treatment of lateral canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (LC-BPPV) motivated the present double-blind randomized trial on the short-term efficacy of the Gufoni liberatory maneuver (GLM). Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Seventy-two patients with unilateral LC-BPPV were recruited for a multicentric study. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment by GLM (n = 37) or sham treatment (n = 35). Subjects were followed up twice (at 1 hour and 24 hours) with the supine roll test by blinded examiners. At 1- and 24-hour follow-up, 75.7% and 83.8% of patients, respectively, undergoing GLM had recovered from vertigo, compared to around 10% of patients undergoing the sham maneuver (P < 0.0001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first class I study on the efficacy of the GLM in the treatment of LC-BPPV in both geotropic and apogeotropic forms. GLM proved highly effective compared to the sham maneuver (P < 0.0001). The present class I study of the efficacy of the GLM changes the level of recommendation of the method for treating LC-BPPV from level U to level B for the geotropic variant and from level B to level A for the apogeotropic variant of LC-BPPV.</td>

	<td> Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a very common vestibular disorder characterized by brief but intense attacks of rotatory vertigo triggered by simple rapid movement of the head. The integrity of the vestibular pathways can be assessed using tests such as digital vectoelectronystagmography (VENG) and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP).  This study aimed to determine the VEMP findings with respect to latency, amplitude, and waveform peak to peak and the results of the oculomotor and vestibular components of VENG in patients with BPPV.  Although this otoneurological condition is quite common, little is known of the associated VEMP and VENG changes, making it important to research and describe these results.  We examined the records of 4438 patients and selected 35 charts after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 26 patients were women and 9 men. The average age at diagnosis was 52.7 years, and the most prevalent physiological cause, accounting for 97.3% of cases, was ductolithiasis. There was a statistically significant association between normal hearing and mild contralateral sensorineural hearing loss. The results of the oculomotor tests were within the normal reference ranges for all subjects. Patients with BPPV exhibited symmetrical function of the semicircular canals in their synergistic pairs (p < 0.001). The caloric test showed statistically normal responses from the lateral canals. The waveforms of all patients were adequate, but the VEMP results for the data-crossing maneuver with positive positioning showed a trend toward a relationship for the left ear Lp13. There was also a trend towards an association between normal reflexes in the caloric test and the inter-peak VEMP of the left ear. It can be concluded that although there are some differences between the average levels of the VENG and VEMP results, these differences were not statistically significant.  In conclusion, the results of audiologic assessment, hearing thresholds, positioning maneuvers, and caloric tests have no effect on the quantitative results of VEMP. Additional research is warranted to establish the relationships among VENG, VEMP, and BPPV, especially as concerns the oculomotor tests.</td>

The search was limited to articles published in English language in the last three decades. The search was done on 1/11/2011. For the 18 relevant articles, we applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria and only 9 articles were included. The data collected from each article were statistically analyzed utilizing meta-analytic Review Manager (RevMan 5.1) software. (Version: 5.1.0.0). There were no significant differences between patients instructed with postural restriction after undergoing repositioning maneuver and patients left free to move after undergoing repositioning maneuver with regard to the presence or absence of post-maneuver symptoms. In conclusion, post-maneuver restrictions do not add to the success of the treatment of BPPV and there is no reason to submit patients to these impractical instructions.</td>

	<td>To determine whether the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) of the computerized dynamic posturography battery or the Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance (CTSIB) is more likely to indicate balance disorders in people with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Normal controls were compared to patients with unilateral BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal. Subjects performed tests with eyes open or closed on stable and unstable surfaces, with head still or with head moving at 0.33 Hz in pitch or yaw. Dependent variables were the percent time of the standard duration each subject could perform the task, the number of head motions made, and kinematic variables measured with head- and torso-mounted inertial motion units. Because equilibrium scores of control subjects improved significantly over repeated trials on SOT, patients were given only one trial per condition. For percent time between-group differences were found on CTSIB with eyes closed, on foam, head moving in yaw showing significantly reduced performance by BPPV subjects compared to controls. Compared to controls, patients made significantly fewer head movements on CTSIB, eyes closed, on foam, head still, in pitch and yaw. Kinematic data also differed between the groups on tests with eyes closed and unstable surfaces with different head movement combinations, indicating increased instability in BPPV patients. For screening, CTSIB with head movements is more likely than SOT to indicate balance deficits, especially when dependent measures include percent time as well as head movement counts and kinematic measures.</td>

This study focused on 12 patients definitively diagnosed with pBPPV showing typical nystagmus by Dix-Hallpike maneuver and 12 controls. In these subjects, oVEMPs and cVEMPs to air-conducted 500 Hz tone burst (125 dB SPL) were measured. The patients also underwent caloric tests. More of the patients with pBPPV showed abnormal responses in oVEMPs by stimulation on their affected side than the controls, while the results of cVEMPs showed no significant differences between pBPPV patients and controls. The abnormal results for oVEMPs on the affected side showed a higher percentage than those for cVEMPs and caloric tests in pBPPV patients. There was no significant association between any of the tests. These findings support the possibility that oVEMP reflects the specific abnormal condition in pBPPV, i.e. that the urticular function in pBPPV patients was highly damaged.</td>

This review highlights the challenges brought on by this disparity and recent advances in genetics, which provide hope for improved diagnosis and treatment of vestibular loss. Linkage analysis has resulted in mapping of genetic loci for familial vestibulopathies with normal hearing and migraine. Targeted gene therapy provides hope for those with permanent vestibular loss. Recent discoveries emphasize the need for better ascertainment of vestibular loss in general clinical practice.</td>

The lateral canal canalolithiasis patients were also divided into two groups: one underwent the Lempert manoeuvre and the other received medication. Lastly, the lateral canal cupulolithiasis patients were treated with medication and non-specific physical techniques. For patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, resolution time was significantly shorter in the Epley manoeuvre group than in the medication group. For the lateral canal canalolithiasis patients, resolution time was significantly shorter in the Lempert manoeuvre group than in the medication group. Resolution time was significantly longer in the lateral canal cupulolithiasis patients than in the other patients. The average age of patients increased with the number of recurrences, as did predominance in females. Average age and rate of sensorineural hearing loss were significantly higher in patients with intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo compared with those in the curable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo group.</td>

	<td>Idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a strong indicator of decreased bone density (osteopenia/osteoporosis) in postmenopausal women, and there is a correlation between BPPV and serum levels of biochemical markers of bone turnover. Prospective pilot clinical trial. Two groups of postmenopausal women were recruited. The BPPV group consisted of 16 women with a diagnosis of BPPV. The OSTEO group consisted of 13 women with history of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan results were compared, along with serum levels of ionized calcium (iCa), vitamin D, aminoterminal propeptide of protocollagen type I (P1NP), and aminoterminal telopeptides of collagen (sNTX). Prevalence of decreased bone mass density among BPPV subjects was 81%, and prevalence of BPPV among OSTEO subjects was 31%. BPPV subjects had higher P1NP levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that among BPPV subjects, there was positive correlation between P1NP and sNTX and a negative correlation between P1NP and vitamin D level. Age was positively correlated with serum levels of both biomarkers among the BPPV subjects. T score, serum iCa, and serum vitamin D levels did not appear to correlate with presence of BPPV. Idiopathic BPPV subjects have a high prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Levels of biochemical markers of bone turnover correlate with presence of BPPV. Our results, based on a sample of U.S. subjects, support an association between idiopathic BPPV and disorders of bone turnover.</td>

The localization and lateralization of BPPV were based on positional test using video eye movement recording system and videonystagmography. Onset of BPPV after surgery, distributions of involved semicircular canals, response to particle repositioning maneuver and factors that may influence the development of secondary BPPV after surgical drilling of the temporal bone. Onset of positional vertigo was mostly within 3 days except 1 case (sixth postoperative day). Postoperative BPPV was usually in the contralateral ear in 9 cases (90%), which occurred predominantly on the contralateral horizontal canal in 8 patients (80%). Positional vertigo was resolved after repositioning maneuvers in every case. None of them showed aggravation of bone conduction threshold. The incidence of BPPV after surgical drilling of the temporal bone was around 1%, and the horizontal semicircular canal of the contralateral ear was predominantly involved. Head position during surgery (head restriction to contralateral ear down) as well as limitation of head movement due to compressive mastoid bandage after surgery seems to be responsible for such predominance.</td>

	<td>Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) has increasingly been utilized for the last 15 years for the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We assess the short- and long-term efficacy of CRP on the treatment of patients with BPPV. Nine hundred sixty-five patients (481 men and 484 women, from 18 to 87 years of age) were enrolled in this prospective study during 1995-2010. Inclusion criteria were a patient history compatible with BPPV and a positive provocative maneuver (either Dix-Hallpike or Roll test). Reported duration of symptoms at the time of their first examination varied from 1 day to 18 months. Variants of the Epley and Barbeque maneuver were used for posterior and anterior canal involvement, and horizontal canal involvement, respectively. Short-term follow-up was obtained 48 h and 7 days after initial treatment, whereas long-term follow-up was obtained at repeated 6-month intervals. Symptoms subsided immediately in 819 patients (85%) by the first CRP. Only 19 patients (2%) required CRP more than 3 times. Patients' mean follow-up was 74 months; symptom recurrence was noted in 139 patients. A statistically significantly higher recurrence rate was noted in elderly people or those with head trauma or a history of vestibular neuropathy (p<0.001). This study provides class IV evidence that CRP remains an efficient and long-lasting noninvasive treatment for BPPV, especially for younger patients without a history of head trauma or vestibular neuropathy. Elderly people have a significantly higher recurrence rate requiring additional education to minimize potential morbidity of their falls.</td>

	<td>The apogeotropic variant of horizontal semicircular canal (h-SCC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is attributed to canalithiasis of the anterior arm or cupulolithiasis. This study is an attempt to distinguish the most effective maneuvers for each case, by investigating any correlation, between the clinical findings or the treatment options and the possible location of the displaced debris. A review of the literature (1990-2012) was conducted via the PubMed database with the search terms "apogeotropic nystagmus and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo." Articles on central nervous system lesions were excluded. The studies included in the analysis provided detailed diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, supported by the resolution of the signs and symptoms through repositioning maneuvers. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons were performed through Pearson's χ or Fischer's exact test. Protocols vary considerably among studies. Nystagmus from seated to supine position is the best studied secondary clinical sign and possibly a clinical indication of cupulolithiasis. In patients with symmetrical responses in the head yaw test, no significant differences can be detected in the occurrence of secondary signs of lateralization compared to patients with asymmetrical responses. The Gufoni maneuver seems to be effective in all pathophysiologic types of apogeotropic h-SCC BPPV. The Barbeque and Vannucchi-Asprella maneuvers mainly target at lithiasis of the anterior ampullary arm. The results of this analysis may imply that different clinical subgroups of h-SCC BPPV may regard to different pathophysiologic and therapeutical mechanisms.</td>

	<td>Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. </td>

Eight patients (4 women, 4 men) with symptoms of persistent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo presented for chiropractic care. The outcome measures included self-reported resolution of vertigo, a Short Form 12 Health Survey, Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Outcome measures were assessed at initial assessment, 6 days, 30 days, and 3 months postintervention. The patients underwent one or more canalith repositioning procedures (Epley maneuver). Scores in each of the categories decreased from the initial to 6-day assessment and then again at the 30-day assessment. The effects of the treatment on the Short Form 12 scores showed changes between the initial assessment and 30 days posttreatment. The patients in this case series demonstrated reduction in symptoms with chiropractic management.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder. However, BPPV in children has been studied less extensively than in the adult population. This is because the observation of benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPN) in children is technically very difficult and BPPV is rare in children. In this study, we present the only two cases of BPPV in children in which we successfully recorded and analyzed the BPPN. One case was an 11-year-old boy and the other was a 3-year-old girl. We analyzed their BPPN three-dimensionally. Apogeotropic positional nystagmus was observed in the first case. We analyzed it to verify the presence of cupulolithiasis in the horizontal semicircular canal (HSCC). Geotropic positional nystagmus was observed in the second case, and the analyzed data indicated the presence of canalolithiasis in HSCC. Over the last decade, we have examined 3341 patients complaining of vertigo or dizziness. Among them, there were 63 children with the same complaint, so that the proportion of cases of BPPV in children was only 3% (2/63). Among patients complaining of vertigo or dizziness, children with BPPV are rare (3%). However, we have recorded their BPPN to confirm that BPPV does occur in children and that their characteristics of positional nystagmus are generally identical to those in adults. We emphasize that this is the first report of a child as young as 3 years old being diagnosed with BPPV.</td>

	<td>Migraine is a common illness and migraine-related dizziness occurs in up to 3% of the population. Because the diagnosis is controversial and may be difficult, many patients go undiagnosed and untreated. This review summarizes current understanding of the taxonomy and diagnosis of vestibular migraine, the relation of vestibular migraine to labyrinthine disease, and the treatment of the condition in adults and children. The categories of migraine accepted by the International Headache Society do not reflect the complex presentations of patients suspected of having vestibular migraine. In clinical practice and research, criteria are increasingly accepted that divide patients suspected of vestibular migraine into 'definite vestibular migraine' and 'probable vestibular migraine.' Because vertigo itself may trigger migraine, patients with vestibular migraine should be suspected of having vestibular end-organ disease until proven otherwise. Treatment remains controversial because of a notable lack of randomized controlled studies of vestibular migraine treatment. For now, the best strategy for the treatment of suspected vestibular migraine patients is dietary/lifestyle modification, antinausea/antiemetics for acute vertigo, and preventive medication for patients who have continued disruptive symptoms. Patients with vestibular migraine should be monitored regularly for the development of latent audiovestibular end-organ disease.</td>

	<td>The findings suggest that in patients with posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (P-BPPV), head trauma and prolonged bedrest, but not inner ear disease, are risk factors for poor outcome of a single Epley maneuver and persistent residual positional vertigo. We first examined the efficacy of a single Epley maneuver and then assessed the time course in remission of residual positional vertigo in patients with idiopathic P-BPPV and secondary P-BPPV. A total of 157 patients with idiopathic P-BPPV and 40 patients with secondary P-BPPV (secondary to head trauma in 8 patients, to prolonged bedrest in 14 patients, and to inner ear disease in 18 patients) were treated with a single Epley maneuver. The negative rates of the Dix-Hallpike test on day 7 after a single Epley maneuver in both patients with P-BPPV secondary to head trauma (25%) and those with prolonged bedrest (36%) were significantly lower than that (73%) in patients with idiopathic P-BPPV. Additionally, the remission of residual positional vertigo in the former groups of patients was significantly delayed in comparison with that of the latter group. However, there were no significant differences in the efficacy of a single Epley maneuver and persistent residual positional vertigo between idiopathic P-BPPV and P-BPPV secondary to inner ear disease.</td>

	<td>Dizziness/vertigo is one of the most common complaint and handicapping condition among patients aged 65 years and older (Geriatric patients). This study was conducted to assess the impact of dizziness/vertigo on the quality of life in the geriatric patients attending a geriatric outpatient clinic. A cross-sectional study was performed in a geriatric outpatient clinic of a rural teaching tertiary care hospital in central India. In all consecutive geriatric patients with dizziness/vertigo attending geriatric outpatient clinic, DHI questionnaire was applied to assess the impact of dizziness/vertigo and dizziness associated handicap in the three areas of a patients' life: physical, functional and emotional domain. Later, each patient was evaluated and underwent Dix-Hallpike maneuver by the physician who was blind of the DHI scoring of the patient. We compared means and proportions of variables across two categories of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and non-BPPV. For these comparisons we used Student's t-test to test for continuous variables, chi-square test for categorical variables and Fisher's exact test in the case of small cell sizes (expected value<5). The magnitude of dizziness/vertigo was 3%. Of the 88 dizziness/vertigo patients, 19 (22%) and 69(78%) cases, respectively, were attributed to BPPV and non-BPPV group. The association of DHI score ≥50 with the BPPV was found to be statistically significant with x(2) value = 58.2 at P<0.01. DHI Score is a useful tool for the prediction of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Correct diagnosis of BPPV is 16 times greater if the DHI Score is greater than or equal to 50. The physical, functional and emotional investigation of dizziness, through the DHI, has demonstrated to be a valuable and useful instrument in the clinical routine.</td>

	<td>The ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) is thought to originate from the contralateral utricular organ. However, the clinical use of oVEMP has not yet been established. This study aimed to clarify whether oVEMP could be used to detect utricular dysfunction in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Sixteen patients with BPPV underwent oVEMP measurements. Recordings were made on 2 separate occasions: when typical nystagmus was confirmed (pretreatment oVEMP) and 1 week after performing Epley's maneuver (posttreatment oVEMP). Results were evaluated using the asymmetry ratio (AR) of n1-p1 wave peak-to-peak amplitude and defined as reduced oVEMP when AR was >31.6%, or augmented oVEMP when AR was <-31.6%. Bilateral responses were recorded in 13 patients on the pretreatment oVEMP. Abnormal results were found in 11 patients (84.5%). These included 5 patients with reduced response and 6 with augmented response. On the posttreatment oVEMP, abnormal results were found in 5 patients (38.5%). All indicated reduced oVEMP. Abnormal results on the pretreatment oVEMP were not related to any persistent positional vertigo (p>0.05, Fisher's exact test). Three out of 4 patients (75.0%) with continuing unsteadiness had abnormal results (reduced response) on the posttreatment oVEMP. The oVEMP measurements indicated abnormal function of the utricle in patients with BPPV. Reduced oVEMP is thought to originate from the partial degeneration of utricular hair cells. Conversely, augmented oVEMP in the affected ear is thought to originate from a hypermobility of the stereocilia due to the detachment of otoconia within the utricle. The above-mentioned utricular dysfunction should be independent of the existence of otoconia in the semicircular canal; thus, the results of oVEMP were not related to the recovery of symptoms. oVEMP can be reliably used to detect utricular lesions in patients with BPPV.</td>

	<td>The treatment of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo often involves repositioning maneuvers and exercises; however, these procedures may not be suitable for patients with limb disabilities or back disorders, or for elder patients. We sought to develop a simple therapeutic maneuver as an alternative procedure, suitable for patients with a wide range of physical ability. A simple therapeutic maneuver, supine to prolonged lateral position, was developed based on the mechanism of canalolithiasis. Its efficacy in treating posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was evaluated in a prospective study consisting of 81 objective and 13 subjective posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients. A successful outcome was defined as a negative Dix-Hallpike test within 2 weeks followed by the continued absence of symptoms of vertigo or dizziness for the next 4 weeks. Seventy-two patients with objective posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and all 13 patients with subjective posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were successfully treated: resolution rates were 88.9 and 100 %, respectively. In the objective group, negative Dix-Hallpike tests were obtained at 1 and 2 weeks in 66.7 and 88.9 % of patients, respectively. In the subjective group, the percentages of patients free of side-dependent vertigo illusions at 1 and 2 weeks were 84.6 and 100 %, respectively. These results suggest that the supine to prolonged lateral position maneuver, which is easy to perform and generally well tolerated, could be recommended as an alternative treatment modality for patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

Prospective study at a tertiary hospital. A total of 521 patients with BPPV involving the posterior or horizontal SCCs performed questionnaires at initial visit asking to choose the initial provoking position among the 10 positions corresponding to one of the three planes (roll, pitch, or yaw). After excluding 45 patients showing signs of simultaneous multiple canal or anterior canal involvement, the frequency of the provoking positions and the correlation between the side of the provoking position and the ear affected by BPPV were analyzed. There were 239 patients with posterior SCC BPPV (p-BPPV) and 237 patients with horizontal SCC BPPV (h-BPPV). The waking-up position was the most common provoking position in both types of BPPV. Statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the side of the provoking position at the onset of vertigo and the affected side by BPPV (P < .01) in patients with p-BPPV as well as h-BPPV (geotropic type [Geo]), but not in patients with h-BPPV (apogeotropic type [Apo]). History taking regarding the side of provoking position at the onset of vertigo may help predict the side affected by BPPV in p-BPPV and h-BPPV (Geo). When h-BPPV (Apo) is suspected, further detailed examinations using additional localization methods should be performed.</td>

	<td>To present a framework for the diagnosis and treatment of inner ear disorders, with an emphasis on problems common to neuro-rehabilitation. Disorders of the inner ear can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo and imbalance. Hearing loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed; conductive hearing loss arises from the ear canal or middle ear, while sensorineural hearing loss arises from the inner ear or auditory nerve. Vertigo is a hallucination of motion, and is the cardinal symptom of vestibular system disease. It should be differentiated from other causes of dizziness: gait imbalance, disequilibrium, lightheadedness (pre-syncope). Vertigo can be caused by problems in the inner ear or central nervous system. The diagnosis of inner ear disorders begins with a targeted physical examination. The initial work-up of hearing loss is made by audiometry, and vertigo by electronystagmography (ENG). Supplemental tests and MRI are obtained when clinically indicated. The clinical pattern and duration of vertigo are the most important clinical features in the diagnosis. Common inner ear causes of vertigo include: vestibular neuritis (sudden, unilateral vestibular loss), Meniere's disease (episodic vertigo), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and bilateral vestibular loss. Common central nervous system causes of vertigo include: post concussion syndrome, cervical vertigo, vestibular migraine, cerebrovascular disease, and acoustic neuroma. A basic knowledge of vestibular physiology, coupled with a understanding of common vestibular syndromes, will lead to correct diagnosis and treatment in most cases.</td>

Some patients also present with spontaneous nystagmus. The aim of this study is to examine the clinical manifestation of spontaneous nystagmus in HSC-BPPV and evaluate the effect on the treatment outcome. Electronystagmography and video eye movement recordings of 125 patients diagnosed as HSC-BPPV were reviewed retrospectively. Presence of spontaneous nystagmus was analyzed and treatment outcome after repositioning therapy was compared. Overall, spontaneous nystagmus was observed in 19 patients (15.2%) with HSC-BPPV at initial presentation. In canalolithiasis group (n=64), the treatment outcome did not differ between patients with or without spontaneous nystagmus. However, in cupulolithiasis group (n=61), patients presenting with spontaneous nystagmus (n=10) required more repositioning therapy sessions. The presence of spontaneous nystagmus at initial presentation may implicate poorer treatment outcome in cupulolithiasis HSC-BPPV patients.</td>

Final status at the end of the follow-up period was better in posterior canal BPPV (95% cure) than in horizontal or superior canal BPPV (87% cure in both cases). This may be explained by two facts: a poorer initial response to repositioning maneuvers in anterior canal BPPV than in BPPV involving the other two canals, and a poorer response to maneuvers in recurrences of horizontal canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most commonly diagnosed vestibular vertigo. BPPV can be diagnosed by clinical examination and its treatment is based on particle repositioning manoeuvres, and specialized equipment is not required. Therefore, most patients could be diagnosed and treated by their general practitioner. Unfortunately, not all positional vertigos are benign. Symptoms similar to those of BPPV can be caused by diseases that affect the central nervous system. It must be possible to define criteria that allow us to suspect, in a patient with symptoms of positional vertigo, the possibility of a cerebral origin ('non-benign PV'). Requests for magnetic resonance imaging must be justified by the fulfillment of these criteria. That is especially relevant in primary care, because these criteria should make possible to distinguish between patients with positional vertigo that could be treated by general practitioner and patients that need to be directed to especialized units. We propose the following revised criteria for suspected non-benign PV: (i) association with signs or symptoms of neurological disorder, (ii) nystagmus without dizziness in positional diagnostic tests, (iii) atypical nystagmus direction, (iv) poor response to therapeutic manoeuvres and (v) recurrence (confirmed by positional tests) on at least three occasions.</td>

	<td>Although it is uncommon for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to affect more than one canal simultaneously, it is not exceptional. We attempt to determine whether these patients present differences relative to "single-canal" cases. A prospective study was done in patients with BPPV, divided into three groups: single-canal BPPV, multi-canal BPPV in one ear and multi-canal BPPV in both ears. Diagnosis was by Dix and Hallpike, supine roll and cephalic hyperextension tests. Treatment was according to the affected canals, by Semont, Epley, Lempert and Yacovino manoeuvres. Aetiology, sex, age, response to treatment, recurrence and final status in each of the three groups was evaluated. Five hundred and eighty-three patients were diagnosed with BPPV: 537 single-canal (92 %) and 46 multi-canal (8 %); of the latter, 36 bilateral and 10 unilateral cases. Basic differences between groups were: greater percentage of idiopathic cases in single-canal (p < 0.0001, Chi-square), greater percentage of post-traumatic cases in bilateral multi-canals (p = 0.006, Chi-square) and prior history of BPPV was more common in unilateral multi-canal (p = 0.006, Chi-square). No differences between groups in response to treatment, recurrence and final status were detected. There are aetiological differences between patients with single-canal BPPV, unilateral multi-canal BPPV and bilateral multi-canal BPPV. Response to therapeutic manoeuvres, however, shows that over 90 % of the patients in all the groups are cured.</td>

The relative frequency of the different forms is as follows: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) 17.1%; phobic vestibular vertigo 15%; central vestibular syndromes 12.3%; vestibular migraine 11.4%; Menière's disease 10.1%; vestibular neuritis 8.3%; bilateral vestibulopathy 7.1%; vestibular paroxysmia 3.7%. Selective literature survey with particular regard to Cochrane reviews and the guidelines of the German Neurological Society. In more than 95% of cases BPPV can be successfully treated by means of liberatory maneuvers (controlled studies); the long-term recurrence rate is 50%. Corticosteroids improve recovery from acute vestibular neuritis (one controlled, several noncontrolled studies); the risk of recurrence is 2-12%. A newly identified subtype of bilateral vestibulopathy, termed cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), shows no essential improvement in the long term. Long-term high-dose treatment with betahistine is probably effective against Menière's disease (noncontrolled studies); the frequency of episodes decreases spontaneously in the course of time (> 5 years). The treatment of choice for vestibular paroxysmia is carbamazepine (noncontrolled study). Aminopyridine, chlorzoxazone, and acetyl-DL-leucine are new treatment options for various cerebellar diseases. Most vestibular syndromes can be treated successfully. The efficacy of treatments for Menière's disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and vestibular migraine requires further research.</td>

In the case of acute vertigo disorders in particular, a five-step procedure has proved to be helpful: the cover test to look for skew deviation as the central sign and component of the ocular tilt reaction, an examination with and without Frenzel's goggles to differentiate between peripheral vestibular spontaneous nystagmus and central fixation nystagmus, an examination of smooth pursuit and gaze-holding function and finally the head-impulse test to look for a deficit in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Considerable advances have been made in the treatment of vertigo disorders in the last 10 years, e.g., cortisone for the treatment of acute vestibular neuritis, betahistine as a high-dosage, long-term treatment for Menière's disease, carbamazepine to treat vestibular paroxysmia and aminopyridine for downbeat nystagmus and episodic ataxia type 2.</td>

The age, sex, occupation, colour of skin, chief complaints, obesity, provisional diagnosis, and incidence of sun exposure was noted in all cases. A total of 86 patients were examined, maximum patients were in the age group of 7-15 years. The chief complaints in majority of the patients were sore throat with recurrent upper respiratory tract infection. Only in three patient's vitamin D level was found to be with in normal limits. In rest 83 (96.51 %) it was either deficient 57 (66.28 %) or insufficient 21 (24.42 %). The incidence of vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in Ear Nose Throat disease (E.N.T.) patients. The results of vitamin supplementation were promising in cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with cervical spondylosis and URTI with asthma, empirical supplementation of vitamin D in all E.N.T. patients not responding to conventional treatment is worth trying. At place of sun screen, use of pomegranates and blueberries may be encouraged to prevent sunburn and eliminate Vitamin D deficiency. </td>

	<td>To establish a possible causal factor for residual dizziness (RD) after successful repositioning maneuvers in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Ninety consecutive patients with idiopathic BPPV were treated with repositioning maneuvers, and the rate of RD was assessed as well as clinical data. Posturography and assessment of anxiety levels were performed on patients reporting RD. Results were compared with a control group of BPPV patients of the sample after repositioning maneuvers and without RD. Twenty-eight subjects (31.1%) reported RD on the second day after successful repositioning maneuvers. The mean duration of RD was 11.6 ± 3.9 days. Patients with RD presented a higher duration of BPPV (14.1 vs. 10.9 days, p = 0.01). A correlation was demonstrated between the duration of BPPV and duration of RD (p < 0.01). Subjects with RD presented increased body sways, above all in eyes-closed conditions. RD is mainly correlated with duration of vertigo in BPPV patients. Anxiety was demonstrated to play a role in increased body sways.</td>

The randomized controlled trials (RCT) about modified Epley maneuver Versus modified Semont maneuver for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from January 1985 to July 2013 were searched in CNKI,OVID, PubMed, CBM, EMBASE, WanFang Data, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently screened the literatures, extracted the data, and evaluated the methodological quality. Then meta-analyses were conducted by using RevMan 5.1 software. A total of six RCTs were included. Among the 453 patients involved, 232 patients were in the modified Epley maneuver group, while the other 221 patients were in the modified Semont maneuver group. The results of meta-analyses showed that the efficacy of the modified Epley maneuve group was superior to that of the modified Semont maneuver group in one-week cure rate[OR = 3.25, 95%CI (2.08, 5.10) , P < 0.01], one-week efficient [OR = 4.72, 95%CI (1.16, 19.15) , P = 0.03], with significant differences.

	<td>Common complications associated with dental implant surgery are well recognized and are usually explained to patients during the process of informed consent. For the general dental practitioner, the periodontist, and the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it is relevant to also be familiar with less frequent complications. This review gathers unusual complications of this surgical procedure and presents unique complications from single case reports. Studies were located using systematic searches in Medline and the Cochrane Library electronic databases. Key words included the terms "implant", "dental", "oral", "complication", "unusual", and "rare". References from the relevant articles were also double-checked. The review was limited to English and German language articles, published within the last 15 years. 17 different unusual complications were identified. The majority of studies report five different complications: permanent nerve injury, damage to teeth adjacent to the implant, excessive bleeding resulting in hematoma of the floor of the mouth, mandibular fracture, and displacement of implants into the maxillary sinus. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and a plunging ranula were reported sporadically. Another 10 complications were only described once in our literature search. Unusual complications are challenging. It is important for the dental practitioner to be aware of all the possible complications and to recognize them early so that adequate therapy can immediately be ensured.</td>

We studied whether benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) could also be an explanation. To assess the prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in patients with Parkinson's disease, with and without dizziness. 305 consecutive outpatients with PD completed the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinsons' Disease Rating Scale-motor score, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a test for orthostatic hypotension. When positive for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, a repositioning maneuver was performed. Patients were followed for three months to determine the clinical response. 305 patients responded (186 men (61%), mean age 70.5 years (Standard Deviation 9.5 years)), of whom 151 (49%) complained of dizziness. 57 (38%) of the dizzy patients appeared to have orthostatic hypotension; 12 patients (8%) had a classical but previously unrecognized benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A further four patients (3%) had a more atypical presentation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Three months after treatment, 11 (92%) of patients with classical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were almost or completely without complaints. We found no 'hidden' benign paroxysmal positional vertigo among patients without dizziness. The prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo among all patients with PD was 5.3%. Among Parkinson patients with symptoms of dizziness, up to 11% may have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which can be treated easily and successfully.</td>

	<td>The indications for surgical treatment of labyrinthine vertigo associated with severe impairment and a lack of response to medication are heterogeneous. Due to different therapeutic goals and success parameters, the results of treatments can only be compared to a limited extent. This overview of the current literature and procedures performed by the author contains recommendations for indications and outlines the risks associated with operative therapy of vestibular vertigo. Results of function-preserving and ablative therapies are compared. Surgical treatment of Menière's syndrome (non-idiopathic) using tympanostomy tubes is indicated in cases of increased middle ear pressure; Meniere's disease (idiopathic) in its early stages can be treated with the endolymphatic shunt operation to preserve hearing and balance functions and where these techniques fail, with vestibular neurectomy for preservation of hearing or with cochleosacculotomy in the case of deafness. Rare indications are intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS). The function preservation success rate in cases of Meniere's syndrome and disease is 70-88 %, ablative procedures are effective in > 90 % of cases and occlusion of the superior or posterior canals is successful in > 95 % of patients. </td>

There is often a positive family history of migraine in children that present with periodic syndromes. There is a known transformation of periodic syndromes from childhood into adult migraine with and without aura phenotype. There has been an evolution of our understanding of what was initially referred to as periodic symptoms of childhood and more recently been called childhood periodic syndromes and is now evolving into the terminology of episodic symptoms that are associated with migraine. International classification of headache disorders has been instrumental in the evolution of the classification of headache and children adults. The most recent classification utilizes and replaces the periodic symptom terminology with episodic symptoms that will no longer be limited to just childhood. This article will address the evolution of our understanding of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology and management of the episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) frequently occurs in females over 50 years old, suggesting that a postmenopausal decrease in estrogen secretion might be involved in its onset. An estrogen deficiency is generally known to cause osteoporosis through a reduction in bone mass. This study was designed to investigate a clinical association between idiopathic BPPV and osteoporosis. Case-control study. We measured the bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar vertebrae in 61 patients with idiopathic BPPV who were postmenopausal women over 50 years old using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. After being treated with the canalith repositioning maneuver, the patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Our results showed that the incidence of osteoporosis in patients with BPPV was 26.2%, which was similar to those observed in epidemiological surveys conducted in Japan. However, we found that in BPPV patients with osteoporosis, the incidence of recurrence was 56.3%, which was significantly higher than that observed in patients with normal bone mineral density (16.1%). Furthermore, the frequency of BPPV recurrence increased as BMD decreased. These results suggest that osteoporosis is a risk factor for BPPV recurrence. The prognosis of BPPV might be clinically predicted by BMD reduction.</td>

	<td>To review benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and some of the recent literature. As BPPV is such a common diagnosis, it is important to understand the disorder and treatment considerations. Although BPPV is typically an easy diagnosis to make, one must be aware of the differential diagnosis. An unusual entity, convergence spasm, is recently presented and discussed as an addition to the differential diagnosis. The recent literature confirms the efficacy of treatment of BPPV. Large studies of horizontal canal BPPV support the success of the barbeque roll and present the simple head shake as a possible treatment in the apogeotropic form. There is reported success with the less often discussed Gufoni (and its variations) maneuver. The presence of orthoptic nystagmus during treatment has positive predictive value for the success of the maneuver. Although uncommon, canal conversion is important to recognize during treatment as it can be readily treated. BPPV is a very common cause of dizziness and generally straightforward to identify and treat. Awareness of possible horizontal canal variants and nonvestibular differential diagnosis possibilities is important. Repositioning maneuvers of various types are typically successful and understanding the nuances is important in assuring successful outcomes.</td>

VBA lesions in patients older than 65 years of age with BPPV were prospectively investigated by magnetic resonance angiography. Vascular risk factors, blood vessel changes, and vertigo severity were recorded. Age-matched individuals without BPPV were included in the control group. Of 126 patients screened for this study, 104 were included. Relevant comorbidities included diabetes (12 patients), hypertension (23 patients), and dyslipidemia (20 patients). Findings included left or right vertebral artery (VA) stenosis or occlusion (22 patients, 21.2%), VA tortuosity (25 patients, 24.0%), VA dominance (20 patients, 19.2%), basilar artery (BA) stenosis or occlusion (nine patients, 8.6%), and BA tortuosity (12 patients, 11.5%). These abnormal vessels differed between BPPV patients and the control group (all P<0.05). The severity of Vertigo did not differ between the abnormal VA and abnormal BA groups (P>0.05), but did differ between the normal group and the abnormal VA or BA group (P<0.05). Vertigo severity correlated with VA stenosis or occlusion, VA dominance, and unilateral or bilateral VA tortuosity. VBA tortuosity and VA dominance were common in BPPV patients and may contribute toward BPPV. </td>

	<td>Although the efficacy of Semont (SM) and Epley maneuvers (EM) for treatment of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is well established, data comparing SM and EM regarding maneuver-induced canal switch are lacking. We prospectively investigated 102 posterior canal BPPV patients after application of the Semont or the Epley maneuver and looked for the appearance of ipsilateral horizontal canal BPPV symptoms. Although treatment success was similar for SM and EM (67 and 76 %, respectively), there was a significant difference in posterior-to-horizontal canal switch rates. In particular, 4 of 51 patients (7.8 %) of the EM group converted to the geotropic type of horizontal canal BPPV, whereas none of the 51 SM patients exhibited a canal switch. All four patients were cleared with a single barbecue maneuver. Our data suggest a small but significant difference in canal switch rate between EM and SM, which could be partly explained by the higher number of maneuver steps during which the head is in the dependent position throughout the EM.</td>

	<td>To determine the prevalence of otolith dysfunction in patients with refractory benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Unmatched case control. Tertiary care institution. Patients included were diagnosed with BPPV, failed initial in-office canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs), and completed vestibular testing and vestibular rehabilitation (n = 40). Refractory BPPV (n = 19) was defined in patients whose symptoms did not resolve despite vestibular rehabilitation. These patients were compared with a control group of those with nonrefractory BPPV (n = 21) for results of a caloric test, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), and subjective visual vertical (SVV). Forty-six of 251 patients failed initial treatment with in-office CRM. Forty patients met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the cases (refractory BPPV) (n = 19) and controls (nonrefractory BPPV) (n = 21) in terms of age, duration of symptoms, laterality of BPPV, and BPPV symptoms. There was no difference in the prevalence of caloric weakness and cVEMP abnormalities (P > .05), with odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval (CI)]) of having abnormal results among cases vs controls of 1.1818 (0.3329-4.1954) and 4.3846 (0.7627-25.2048), for caloric and cVEMP, respectively. Abnormal eccentric SVV was more prevalent in refractory BPPV cases (58%) than in controls (14%) (P < .0072). The OR (95% CI) of having abnormal SVV was 8.25 (1.7967-37.8822) higher among patients with refractory BPPV than those with nonrefractory BPPV. Patients with refractory BPPV are more likely to have abnormal eccentric SVV and thus underlying utricular dysfunction.

	<td>To investigate the incidence of Lateral Semicircular Canal BPPV (LSC BPPV) with Pseudo-Spontaneous Nystagmus in patients preliminarily diagnosed for vestibular neuritis in the Emergency Department (ED). Retrospective study of 273 patients with acute vertigo and persistent horizontal nystagmus in upright position (male 110, female 163, 14-93 years old) observed over four years. All the patients were checked for any nystagmus modification by performing the Head Pitch Test (HPT) in the upright position. The HPT modified the beating direction of the persistent horizontal nystagmus in 56 of the 273 examined patients. The positioning tests subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of LSC BPPV in all those 56 patients. There were 37 geotropic variants and 19 apogeotropic variants and all of them were successfully treated by performing liberatory manoeuvres in the course of the same session. Performing the HPT in the upright position helps to differentiate a direction fixed nystagmus from a direction changing one, and in so doing, to make the differential diagnosis between vestibular neuritis and LSC BPPV, achieving the goal of successfully treating LSC BPPV in the first session.</td>

	<td>To investigate the potential risk factors associated to the treatment failure and recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Prospective cohort study. Tertiary referral center. Four hundred patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 119 men and 281 women, aged 27 to 88 years. Patients were treated once a week, with only one, appropriate, depending on the affected canal, repositioning maneuver (modified Epley, Semont, barbecue/inverted Gufoni, Kim). The control Dix-Hallpike test and the roll test were performed on 7 days. The treatment outcome and recurrence were evaluated with regard to sex, age, duration of symptoms, etiologic factors, migraines, osteoporosis, vascular risk factors, endocrine diseases, localization of otoconia, and simultaneous involvement of multiple canals. The results indicate that treatment was negatively affected by patients' age, osteoporosis, and head trauma, without them causing recurrent symptoms. The highest number of uncured patients was observed in the 73- to 88-year-old age group (14.8%). The application of more than one maneuver was necessary in 27.5% of cases with primary BPPV and 88.9% with secondary BPPV. The highest treatment success was achieved in the group with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal (F = 3.668, p = 0.026). The recurrence rate was 15.5%. Potential risk factors associated to the treatment failure were as follows: the age older than 50, secondary BPPV, head trauma, the occurrence of osteoporosis, and localization of otoconia in the anterior semicircular canal. The analyzed factors did not have impact on the recurrence.</td>

	<td>BPPV when diagnosed before any repositioning procedure is called primary BPPV. Primary BPPV canalithiasis treatment with repositioning procedures sometimes results in unintentional conversion of BPPV form: transitional BPPV. Objectives were to find transitional BPPV forms, how they influence relative rate of canal involvement and how to be treated. This study is a retrospective case review performed at an ambulatory, tertiary referral center. Participants were 189 consecutive BPPV patients. Main outcome measures were detection of transitional BPPV, outcome of repositioning procedures for transitional canalithiasis BPPV and spontaneous recovery for transitional cupulolithiasis BPPV. Canal distribution of primary BPPV was: posterior canal (Pc): 85.7% (162/189), horizontal canal (Hc): 11.6% (22/189), anterior canal (Ac): 2.6% (5/189); taken together with transitional BPPV it was: Pc: 71.3% (164/230), Hc: 26.5% (61/230), Ac: 2.2% (5/230). Transitional BPPV forms were: Hc canalithiasis 58% (24/41), Hc cupulolithiasis 37% (15/41) and common crux reentry 5% (2/41). Treated with barbecue maneuver transitional Hc canalithiasis cases either resolved in 58% (14/24) or transitioned further to transitional Hc cupulolithiasis in 42% (10/24). In follow-up of transitional Hc cupulolithiasis we confirmed spontaneous recovery in 14/15 cases in less than 2 days. The most frequent transitional BPPV form was Hc canalithiasis so it raises importance of barbecue maneuver treatment. Second most frequent was transitional Hc cupulolithiasis which very quickly spontaneously recovers and does not require any intervention. The rarest found transitional BPPV form was common crux reentry which is treated by Canalith repositioning procedure. Transitional BPPV taken together with primary BPPV may decrease relative rate of Pc BPPV, considerably increase relative rate of Hc BPPV and negligibly influence relative rate of Ac BPPV. Transitional BPPV forms can be produced by repositioning maneuvers (transitional Hc cupulolithiasis) or by the subsequent controlling positional test (transitional Hc canalithiasis and common crux reentry); underlying mechanisms are discussed.</td>

The medical records of 22 patients, who presented with BPPV within 12 weeks after the onset of VN, were reviewed. Data of a complete otolaryngological, audiological, neurotologic and imaging evaluation were available for all patients. Two hundred and eighty-four patients with idiopathic BPPV were used as a control group. The patients with BPPV secondary to VN presented the following features, in which they differed from the patients with idiopathic BPPV: (1) a lower mean age; (2) involvement of the posterior semicircular canal; (3) presence of canal weakness; (4) more therapeutic sessions needed for cure and a higher rate of recurrence. It may be, thus, concluded that BPPV associated with VN differs from idiopathic BPPV in regard to several epidemiological and clinical features, it responds less effectively to treatment and may follow a protracted course, having a tendency for recurrence. </td>

	<td>In the present study, we calculated the success rate of the modified Epley maneuver and determined the effectiveness of post-maneuver positional restriction in terms of the prevention of early and late recurrence. The present study was conducted on 78 patients who had unilateral benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) of the posterior semicircular canal (SCC) and who were treated in the Otorhinolaryngology Department of Susehri State Hospital. The Dix-Hallpike test was performed on all patients. After the involved canal was identified using this test, we guided patients through the modified Epley repositioning maneuver. A maximum of two maneuvers were performed in the same session. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group was not advised any positional restriction, while the second group was advised positional restriction for 10 days after the procedure. Recurrences during 1-90 days after the treatment were noted as early recurrences, while those that occurred after 90 days were noted as late recurrences. In the restriction group (n=39), repositioning was successful after a single maneuver in 32 (82.05%) patients and after two maneuvers in 5 (12.8%) patients. Repositioning failed in two (5.1%) patients. In the non-restriction group (n=39), repositioning was successful after a single maneuver in 31 (79.4%) patients and after two maneuvers in 6 (15.3%) patients. Repositioning failed in two (5.1%) patients. Thus, the success rate was 94.8% in each group. Early recurrence occurred in 3 (8.1%) of 37 patients in the restriction group and 2 (5.4%) of 37 patients in the non-restriction group (p>0.05). Late recurrence occurred in 5 (13.5%) of 37 patients in both the restriction and non-restriction groups (p>0.05). Postural restriction after a canalith repositioning procedure does not improve procedural success or decrease early and late recurrence rates. However, the number of patients was too small to detect a difference between both treatment groups.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is a common medical condition with a broad spectrum of diagnoses which requires an integrated approach to patients through a structured clinical interview and physical examination. The main cause of vertigo in primary care is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which should be confirmed by a positive D-H positional test and treated with repositioning maneuvers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Epley's maneuver performed by general practitioners (GPs) in the treatment of BPPV. This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in the primary care setting. The study's scope will include two urban primary care centers which provide care for approximately 49,400 patients. All patients attending these two primary care centers, who are newly diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, will be invited to participate in the study and will be randomly assigned either to the treatment group (Epley's maneuver) or to the control group (a sham maneuver). Both groups will receive betahistine. Outcome variables will be: response to the D-H test, patients' report on presence or absence of vertigo during the previous week (dichotomous variable: yes/no), intensity of vertigo symptoms on a Likert-type scale in the previous week, total score on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and quantity of betahistine taken. Positive results from our study will highlight that treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be performed by trained general practitioners (GPs) and, therefore, its widespread practice may contribute to improve the quality of life of BPPV patients.

Data from otological asymptomatic controls (n=129) who were referred to the radiology department from other clinics for ultrasound examination were obtained. Intima-media thickness and arteriosclerosis measurements were carried out. Arteriosclerosis measurement was performed through a Doppler ultrasound. No statistically significant difference in carotid, femoral intima-media thicknesses and elastic modulus measurements between the controls and BPPV group. In the BPPV group, carotid artery cross-sectional compliance, cross-sectional distensibility, femoral artery cross-sectional compliance and cross-sectional distensibility were statistically significantly lower.

	<td>Introduction Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for many age-related diseases and symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo. Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the possible association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and regular physical activity in elderly subjects. Methods This cross-sectional study included 491 elderly individuals who lived independently. Physical exercise was assessed through a questionnaire and BPPV by history and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Results The present study indicates no significant association between BPPV with lack of physical activity in men and in the total population. We have confirmed associations between BPPV with lack of physical activity in women (p = 0.01). Women with a sedentary lifestyle who do not practice physical activity are 2.62 more likely to have BPPV than those with regular physical activity. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of identifying risk factors for BPPV that can be modified through specific interventions. Regular physical activity is a lifestyle with potential to decrease the risk of vertigo in women. </td>

	<td>Awareness of the importance of migraine in patients with symptoms of vestibular dysfunction is increasing. This article gives an overview of the multiple facets of the link between migraine and vestibular dysfunction. The vestibular and the headache community have published a consensual definition of vestibular migraine, which is an important step to promote research on the topic and the awareness of clinicians. Vestibular migraine is considered the most common cause of spontaneous recurrent vertigo. So far, the evidence for vestibular migraine has been mainly epidemiological, but the recent follow-up of a cohort over 9 years could show the robustness of the diagnosis over time.Additionally, migraine and vestibular dysfunction have multiple potential interactions and links through a range of comorbidities such as Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, anxiety and motion sickness, which go beyond the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine. The further refinement and wider acceptance of the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine is an important development as it is one the most common vestibular disorders. But the relationship between migraine and vestibular dysfunction is complex and has many aspects beyond vestibular migraine.</td>

	<td>Dizziness in the elderly is a serious health concern due to the increased morbidity caused by falling. The most common cause of dizziness in the elderly, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), is frequently undiagnosed, and bedside treatment of these patients can be difficult due to neck and back stiffness, which makes repeated and accurate repositioning maneuvers difficult. After a fall, a 96-year-old woman was referred by a resident neurologist for intractable BPPV. The patient was placed on a motorized turntable and repositioned to remove the calcite particles from the affected posterior semicircular canal. Video monitoring of the eyes allowed confirmation of the diagnosis, as well as an immediate evaluation of the effectiveness of the maneuver. Every patient with dizziness or imbalance, even in the absence of typical complaints of BPPV, should be tested with provocation maneuvers, because the clinical picture of BPPV is not always typical. Even if elderly patients with dizziness are very frail, the completion of provocation maneuvers is imperative, since the therapeutic maneuvers are extremely effective. A motorized turntable is very helpful to perform the repositioning accurately and safely.</td>

	<td>In our daily life, small flows in the semicircular canals (SCCs) of the inner ear displace a sensory structure called the cupula which mediates the transduction of head angular velocities to afferent signals. We consider a dysfunction of the SCCs known as canalithiasis. Under this condition, small debris particles disturb the flow in the SCCs and can cause benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), arguably the most common form of vertigo in humans. The diagnosis of BPPV is mainly based on the analysis of typical eye movements (positional nystagmus) following provocative head maneuvers that are known to lead to vertigo in BPPV patients. These eye movements are triggered by the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and their velocity provides an indirect measurement of the cupula displacement. An attenuation of the vertigo and the nystagmus is often observed when the provocative maneuver is repeated. This attenuation is known as BPPV fatigue. It was not quantitatively described so far, and the mechanisms causing it remain unknown. We quantify fatigue by eye velocity measurements and propose a fluid dynamic interpretation of our results based on a computational model for the fluid-particle dynamics of a SCC with canalithiasis. Our model suggests that the particles may not go back to their initial position after a first head maneuver such that a second head maneuver leads to different particle trajectories causing smaller cupula displacements. </td>

A comprehensive search, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane as data sources, resulted in 44 original papers for randomized trials that compared the Gufoni maneuver with other maneuvers (date of search: April 23, 2013). Three studies (389 patients) remained after screening of title, abstract, and full text. After method assessment, 2 of these 3 studies were considered to have a low risk of bias and a high level of validity. The third study did not properly report the treatment allocation and blinding; moreover, outcome data were incomplete. The first 2 studies compared the Gufoni maneuver with a sham maneuver (and the barbecue roll in one study). The third study compared the Gufoni maneuver with a treatment with vestibular suppressants and with the barbecue roll (plus forced prolonged positioning). All 3 studies reported short-term results. Midterm results (1 month) were reported in 2 studies. Given the variety in the comparative treatments and follow-up duration, all 3 studies showed that the Gufoni maneuver was more effective than the sham maneuver or treatment with vestibular suppressants. All agreed that the maneuver was easy to perform, which made it suitable for older, immobile, and obese patients. However, there were insufficient data to establish the relative efficacy of the Gufoni maneuver compared with other maneuvers.</td>

	<td>Atypical variants of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are often encountered and frequently confusing. The authors present a hypothetical framework that accounts for all classical patterns of BPPV and several unusual variants such as BPPV without nystagmus, BPPV with downbeat nystagmus and BPPV with paradoxically direction-changing nystagmus. The authors introduce new concepts, such as "ipsicanal switch" and "horizontal short arm canalolithiasis" and suggest that their use may improve diagnosis and treatment in everyday clinical practice. The possible consequences of saccular otoconia detachment are reviewed according to the literature. </td>

	<td>To review new clinical data and theories concerning atypical positional nystagmus in vertical canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Peer reviewed, clinical papers describing nystagmus provoked by positioning in cases with BPPV. Basic scientific articles detailing 3D anatomical reconstructions of the inner ear. In BPPV, it is hypothetically possible that otoconia become dislocated but do not fall into the common crus of the vertical canals or into the horizontal canal; in these cases, they may gravitate toward the most inferior part of the utriculus, the ampulla of the inferior canal. It is argued that in these cases, depending on their behavior (free-floating or sticking to the cupula) and the precise position of the inferior ampulla, either no nystagmus or a slow downbeat nystagmus should ensue when the patient is positioned from sitting to a Dix-Hallpike position. Such scenarios could hypothetically explain commonly seen clinical entities such as "subjective BPPV" and/or cases with a peripheral positional downbeat nystagmus.</td>

	<td>Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent form of BPPV. It is characterized by a paroxysmal positioning nystagmus evoked through Dix-Hallpike and Semont positioning tests. Anterior canal BPPV (AC) is more rare than posterior canal BPPV; it presents a prevalent down beating positioning nystagmus, with a torsional component clockwise for the left canal, counterclockwise for the right canal. Due to the possible lack of the torsional component, it is sometimes difficult to identify the affected ear. An apogeotropic variant of posterior BPPV (APC) has recently been described, characterised by a paroxysmal positional nystagmus in the opposite direction to the one evoked in posterior canal BPPV: the linear component is down-beating, the torsional component is clockwise for the right canal, counter-clockwise for the left canal, so that a contra-lateral anterior canal BPPV could be simulated. During a 16 month period, of 934 BPPV patients observed, the authors identified 23 (2.5%) cases of apogeotropic posterior canal BPPV and 11 (1.2%) cases of anterior canal BPPV, diagnosed using the specific oculomotor patterns described in the literature. Anterior canal BPPV was treated with the repositioning manoeuvre proposed by Yacovino, which does not require identification of the affected side, whereas apogeotropic posterior canal BPPV was treated with the Quick Liberatory Rotation manoeuvre for the typical posterior canal BPPV, since in the Dix-Hallpike position otoliths are in the same position if they come either from the ampullary arm or from the non-ampullary arm. The direct resolution of BPPV (one step therapy) was obtained in 12/34 patients, 8/23 patients with APC and 4/11 patients with AC; canalar conversion into typical posterior canal BPPV, later treated through Quick Liberatory Rotation (two-step therapy), was obtained in 19 patients,14/23 with APC and 5/11 with AC. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Considering the effects of therapeutic manoeuvres, the authors propose a grading system for diagnosis of AC and APC: "certain" when a canalar conversion in ipsilateral typical posterior canal BPPV is obtained; "probable" when APC or AC are directly resolved; "possible" when disease is not resolved and cerebral neuroimaging is negative for neurological diseases. Our results show that the oculomotor patterns proposed in the literature are effective in diagnosing APC and AC, and that APC is more frequent than AC. Both of these rare forms of vertical canal BPPV can be treated effectively with liberatory manoeuvres.</td>

	<td>The benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common disease in the group of peripheral vertigo. It's characterized by vertiginous sensation triggered by the positional changes of the head and usually lasts less than one minute. It is most frequently seen in middle-aged patients (40-50 years old) and in up 50% of cases we do not know the cause, so we refer to them as idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Because of the high incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in general population, it is of utmost importance to be aware of the differential diagnosis and to be able to treat this pathology with efficacy, because in most cases we can achieve excellent results performing specific and simple maneuvers. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a frequently encountered condition that can severely affect quality of life. Present study was undertaken to investigate whether the platelet (PLT) indices, including mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and platelet crit (PCT), could serve as diagnostic tools in patients with BPPV. Consecutive 45 BPPV patients and age- and sex-matched 40 control subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional prospective study. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients underwent a complete audio-vestibular test battery including Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Routine laboratory analyses were performed in both of the groups. In BPPV patients, PLT, MPV, and PDW were found significantly higher than in controls (P < 0·05). Platelet and mean platelet volume were independently associated with BPPV (P  =  0·002 and P < 0·001, respectively). Platelet and platelet crit were significantly higher in patients with BPPV involving the left labyrinth than in those with the right affected side (P < 0·05). Mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width were to be significantly higher in the BPPV patients with recurrent vertigo attack than in those with first-ever attack (P < 0·001). A cutoff value of 8·75 for MPV and 16·65 for PDW parameters were obtained to identify the recurrence in BPPV patients in the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Elevated PLT indices were associated with BPPV requiring further efforts to better clarify this issue.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a frequently encountered condition that can severely affect the quality of life. In this study, we aimed to assess the possible relations between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and BPPV. Fifty patients with BPPV, and 40 age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study. All the patients and controls underwent a complete audio-vestibular test battery including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and supine roll test for posterior semicircular canal (PSC) and horizontal semicircular canal, respectively. Routine hematological and biochemical analyses were performed in both groups. In the BPPV group, measurements of SUA levels were repeated 1 month after the vertigo attack. The lipid profiles and SUA levels were higher in patients with BPPV than detected in controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Albumin and SUA values were independently associated with BPPV in multiple logistic regression models (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). A cutoff value of 4 for SUA level with a sensitivity of 0.72 (0.58-0.84) and a specificity of 0.60 (0.43-0.75) was obtained in the receiver operating characteristic analyses. There was a significant decrement in SUA level 1 month after the vertigo attack compared with the values obtained during the attack (P < 0.001). Among the most involved type of BPPV (PSC BPPV), the right side was affected in 26 patients (57.8%) and the left side in 19 patients (42.2%). SUA levels did not differ statistically in patients with PSC BPPV for either the right or left sides (P > 0.05). Elevated SUA is positively correlated with BPPV, requiring further efforts to clarify the exact mechanism.</td>

	<td>The authors report a 64-year-old man who developed persistent direction fixed nystagmus after a canalith repositioning maneuver for horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HC-BPPV). The patient was initially diagnosed with right HC-BPPV given that the Dix-Hallpike test showed geotropic horizontal nystagmus that was more pronounced on the right side, although the roll test did not show any positional nystagmus. The patient was treated with a canalith repositioning maneuver (Lempert maneuver). The next day, the patient experienced a different character of dizziness, and left-beating spontaneous nystagmus regardless of head position was observed. After a forced prolonged left decubitus and frequent head shaking, his symptoms and nystagmus resolved. This condition, referred to as canalith jam, can be a complication after the repositioning maneuver in patients with BPPV. Atypical positional tests suggest that abnormal canal anatomy could be the underlying cause of canalith jam. </td>

	<td>Horizontal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (H-BPPV) is more difficult to successfully treat than posterior benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (P-BPPV) because of the diverse mechanisms required. We developed a simple, rapid, and effective treatment algorithm for treating all subtypes of H-BPPV in an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient department. Four hundred ninety patients with BPPV receiving outpatient treatment at Mackay Memorial Hospital were investigated. Among the 490 patients, 86 (17.6%; 86/490) were diagnosed as having H-BPPV variants using the McClure-Pagnini test. Fifty-four patients were female, and 32 were male; they ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age, 56.2 yr). Among the 86 H-BPPV patients, 74.4% (64/86) were hypothesized to have canalithiasis, 20.9% (18/86) were hypothesized to have cupulolithiasis-utricle type (Cup-U), and 4.7% (4/86) were hypothesized to have the cupulolithiasis-cupula type (Cup-C). The primary treatment maneuver was the forced prolonged position (FPP). For 3 patients exhibiting refractory symptoms, we introduced the Gufoni maneuver. The total average success rate of treatment was 96%. We concluded that for H-BPPV patients with initial geotropic nystagmus, the FPP alone yielded an excellent treatment-control rate, and the barbecue-rotation maneuver was unnecessary. However, observing the nystagmus transformation of apogeotropic patients was necessary before administering treatment. For cupulolithiasis patients with the apogeotropic variant who did not respond to FPP treatment alone, we determined that the Gufoni maneuver was necessary as well.</td>

	<td>To improve the test standards for a version of the Romberg test and to determine whether measuring kinematic variables improved its utility for screening. Healthy controls and patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, postoperative acoustic neuroma resection, and chronic peripheral unilateral weakness were compared. Subjects wore Bluetooth-enabled inertial motion units while standing on the floor or medium-density, compliant foam, with eyes open or closed, with head still or moving in pitch or yaw. Dependent measures were time to perform each test condition, number of head movements made, and kinematic variables. Patients and controls did not differ significantly with eyes open or with eyes closed while on the floor. With eyes closed, on foam, some significant differences were found between patients and controls, especially for subjects older than 59 years. Head movement conditions were more challenging than with the head still. Significantly fewer patients than controls could make enough head movements to obtain kinematic measures. Kinematics indicated that lateral balance control is significantly reduced in these patients compared to controls. Receiver operator characteristics and sensitivity/specificity analyses showed moderately good differences with older subjects. Tests on foam with eyes closed, with head still or moving, may be useful as part of a screening battery for vestibular impairments, especially for older people. 3b.</td>

Edentulous patients in maxillary premolar and molar regions with type III or IV bone were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The patients were randomly divided in two groups: in the test group (magnetic mallet group [MMG]), the implant site was prepared with osteotomes pushed by electrical mallet, while in the control group (hand mallet group [HMG]), the implant site was performed with osteotomes pressed by hand mallet. Implants were immediately loaded. Intraoral digital radiographic measurements were reported at 6, 12, and 24 months. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients were included in MMG and 25 patients in the HMG. One hundred thirty-eight dental implants were placed. In 12 cases, six in MMG and six in HMG, sinus elevation was performed. After 24-month follow-up, a survival rate of 94.93% was reported (MMG and HMG reported a survival rate of 97.10 and 92.75%, respectively, not statistically significant [P > .05]). In control group, two patients claimed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following the use of osteotomes with hand hammer. Marginal bone levels remained stable over time for both groups, and no statistically significant differences were found. After 12 months, the bone height increased in both groups and, at 24 months, was stable. Statistical analysis reported no significant differences between test and control groups. These results demonstrated a stable marginal bone levels over time and a significant increase in bone height between 6 and 12 months in osteotome technique. The use of electrical mallet provided some essential clinical advantages for the patients during surgical procedure in comparison with hand mallet.</td>

	<td>Although the repositioning maneuvers are usually very effective in patients with BPPV, some patients still complain residual dizziness. Danhong injection (DHI), a traditional Chinese medicine, can effectively dilate blood vessels and improve microcirculation, and has been proven to be effective in improving cervical vertigo and posterior circulation ischemic vertigo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of DHI on residual dizziness after successful repositioning treatment in patients with BPPV. Eighty-six patients with BPPV were randomized into two treatment groups, DHI group and non DHI group. The DHI group received the same repositioning treatment as the non-DHI group, with the addition of DHI therapy. The durations of residual dizziness of DHI group and non-DHI group were compared. In addition, the scores of the dizziness handicap inventory of these two groups were calculated. The durations of residual dizziness of DHI group were shorter than that of non-DHI group. There were no significant differences in the scores of dizziness handicap inventory in the first week between these two groups, and there were much significant differences in the second, the fourth, the sixth and eighth weeks. The results demonstrate that DHI can significantly improve the residual dizziness after successful repositioning treatment in patients with BPPV.</td>

Secondary objective was defining possible "groups of risk" for people suffering recurrent positional vertigo related to the presence of a well documented comorbidity. This was an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter, spontaneous, non-pharmacological study. The data of 1092 patients suffering BPPV evaluated in 11 different Departments of Otolaryngology, Otoneurology and Neurology, referring Centers for positional vertigo evaluation, were retrospectively collected. Regarding evaluated comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and depression), data analysis showed the presence of at least one comorbid disorder in 216 subjects (19.8%) and 2 or more in 408 subjects (37.4%). Moreover there was a statistical significant difference between the number of comorbidities and the number of recurrences, otherwise said as comorbidity disorders increased the number of relapses increased too. The presence of a systemic disease may worsen the status of the posterior labyrinth causing a more frequent otolith detachment. This condition increases the risk for patients suffering BPPV to have recurrent episodes, even if correctly managed by repositioning maneuvers. The combination of two or more of aforementioned comorbidities further increases the risk of relapsing BPPV, worsened by the presence of osteoporosis. On the basis of this results it was possible to define "groups of risk" useful for predicting BPPV recurrence in patients with one or more comorbidity.</td>

	<td>The aim of this review is to present the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the vestibular compensation and demonstrating how the vestibular rehabilitation is conducted to help the recovery of balance function. Vestibular rehabilitation is based on improving the natural phenomenon called vestibular compensation that occurs after acute vestibular disturbance or chronic and gradual misbalance. Central compensation implies three main mechanisms namely adaptation, substitution and habituation. The compensation, aided by the rehabilitation aimed to compensate and/or to correct the underused or misused of the visual, proprioceptive and vestibular inputs involved in the postural control. As the strategy of equilibration is not corrected, the patient is incompletely cured and remains with inappropriate balance control with its significance on the risk of fall and impact on quality of life. The vestibular rehabilitation helps to correct inappropriate strategy of equilibrium or to accelerate a good but slow compensation phenomenon. Nowadays, new tools are more and more employed for the diagnosis of vestibular deficit (that may include various sources of impairment), the assessment of postural deficit, the control of the appropriate strategy as well to facilitate the efficiency of the rehabilitation especially in elderly people. </td>

	<td>Rehabilitation for athletes with postconcussion syndrome requires emphasis on both cognitive and physical rest with a gradual return to activity and sports. As the athlete becomes more active, the rehabilitation and sport professional should pay close attention to symptoms of concussion, like headache, dizziness, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport provides a systematic approach to increasing the intensity of physical activity while attending to postconcussion symptoms. During the incident that led to a concussion, the injured athlete may have incurred injuries to the vestibular and balance system, which are not directly related to concussion. These conditions are best addressed by professionals with specific training in vestibular rehabilitation, most commonly physical therapists. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a condition in which otoconia particles in the inner ear dislodge into the semicircular canals, resulting in severe vertigo and imbalance. This condition frequently resolves with a few sessions with a vestibular therapist and a home exercise program. In conditions like gaze instability, motion sensitivity, impaired postural control, and cervicogenic dizziness, improvement is more gradual and requires longer follow-up with a physical therapist. In all of these conditions, it is important to consider that the patient with postconcussion syndrome will likely recover more slowly than others and should be monitored for symptoms of postconcussion syndrome throughout intervention. </td>

	<td>To evaluate whether absence of hearing loss on pure-tone audiometry (PTA) is reliable as a diagnostic test for predicting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in adult patients with vertigo. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A systematic literature search was conducted on December 10, 2013. Relevant publications were selected based on title, abstract, and full text. Selected articles were assessed for relevance and risk of bias using predetermined criteria. Prevalence and the positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) were extracted. Of 603 retrieved publications, 1 article with high relevance and moderate risk of bias was included. In this study, the prevalence of BPPV was 28%. The PPV of hearing loss assessed by PTA was 31% (95% CI, 17-49) and the NPV was 73% (95% CI, 61-83). The absence of hearing loss on PTA decreased the risk of BPPV by 1%. There is insufficient high-quality evidence regarding the diagnostic value of the absence of hearing loss, assessed by PTA, for predicting BPPV in adult patients with vertigo.</td>

At 1-month follow-up, the results of the included studies diverged further. Absolute risk differences ranged from 6% (95% CI, -24%-35%) more symptom relief in favor of watchful waiting to 79% (95% CI, 56%-88%) in favor of the Epley maneuver. All data of the selected studies show a benefit in favor of the Epley maneuver at 1-week follow-up in the management of p-BPPV.

	<td>A growing body of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports a specific relationship between vestibular symptoms and migraine. Without a biomarker or complete understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis of vestibular migraine (VM) currently depends upon symptoms in two dimensions: episodic vestibular symptoms temporally related to migraine symptoms. The Bárány Society and the International Headache Society have recently developed consensus diagnostic criteria. However, many issues remain unsettled, including the type, duration, and timing of vestibular symptoms related to headache that should be required for diagnosing VM. This paper focuses on the challenging third dimension of comorbidity, a frequent cause of diagnostic uncertainty that may confound clinical application and research validation of VM criteria. Several other neurotologic conditions occur more frequently in migraineurs than controls, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière's disease, and motion sickness. Patients with VM also have high rates of chronic subjective dizziness, which may be associated with anxious, introverted temperaments that can affect clinical presentation and treatment response. Broadly inclusive studies of well-characterized patients with other neurotologic and psychiatric comorbidities are needed to fully understand how vestibular symptoms and migraine interact in order to truly validate vestibular migraine, distill its essential features, define its boundaries, and characterize overlapping comorbidities. </td>

Retrospective study of all patients with evidence of SSNHL with any type of BPPV between 2008 and 2012. Tertiary care university hospital. Five patients aged 56 to 71 were diagnosed with unilateral profound SSNHL and BPPV. Neurotologic examination revealed an ipsilateral torsional, up-beating nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike exam. Severe or profound ipsilateral-sensorineural hearing loss was recognized on audiometry. The rest of the exam was normal; this was in keeping with the diagnosis of SSNHL with ipsilateral posterior semicircular canal BPPV. All patients were treated with a modified Epley maneuver; oral steroids were administered for two weeks. In all cases vertigo resolved and the Dix-Hallpike exam became normal within several weeks. However, the hearing loss remained unchanged in two patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was normal and ENG caloric test demonstrated mild ipsilateral canal paresis in two patients. 1. Patients with SSNHL and BPPV can have a variable clinical course and outcome. This entity may be quite common, but the diagnosis of BPPV can be missed if a complete neurological physical examination is not performed. 2. Arterial occlusions or selective multiple vascular or neural involvement may explain the pathophysiology of SSNHL with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal.</td>

	<td>Since saccular projection is sound sensitive, the objective is to investigate the possibility that the saccular projections may contribute to auditory brainstem response to 500 HZ tone burst (ABR500 HZ). During the case-control research, twenty healthy controls compared to forty selected case groups as having chronic and resistant BPPV were evaluated in the audiology department of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (Hamadan, Iran). Assessment is comprised of audiologic examinations, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs), and ABR500 HZ. We found that forty affected ears of BPPV patients with decreased vestibular excitability as detected by abnormal cVEMPs had abnormal results in ABR500 HZ, whereas unaffected ears presented normal findings. Multiple comparisons of mean p13, n23 latencies, and peak-to-peak amplitudes between three groups (affected, unaffected, and healthy ears) were significant. In conclusion, the saccular nerves can be projective to auditory bundles and interact with auditory brainstem response to low frequencies. Combine the cVEMPs and ABR500 HZ in battery approach tests of vestibular assessment and produce valuable data for judgment on the site of lesion. Regarding vestibular cooperation for making of wave V, it is reasonable that the term of ABR500 HZ is not adequate and the new term or vestibular-auditory brainstem response to 500 HZ tone burst is more suitable. </td>

	<td>This retrospective study assessed several clinical, case history and functional parameters to investigate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with migraine. Two groups of patients were compared: those affected by BPPV and migraine (group A), as defined by International Headache Society criteria, and those with BPPV without migraine or with another form of headache (group B). The following parameters were investigated: onset of BPPV, recovery time, residual dizziness, recurrence of BPPV, atypical eye movement patterns and Meniere-like vertigo in the inter-critical BPPV period. Mean age at BPPV onset was 39 years +/- 9.2 in Group A and 53 years +/- 7.3 in Group B (p = 0.00). No significant difference emerged in the number of manoeuvres needed to achieve recovery (Group A: 1.7 +/- 0.94; Group B: 1.9 +/- 0.89; p > 0.05). Highly recurrent BPPV (at least 4 documented episodes) was observed in 15 patients from group A (19.4%) and in 8 patients from group B (7.3%). Atypical eyes movements and Meniere-like vertigo were more frequent in migraineurs with highly recurrent BPPV (Chi square = 5.76; p < 0.016). A high prevalence of BPPV and earlier onset in migraine are the main findings of this study. There is a higher incidence of a range of neurotological patterns in the intervals between BPPV episodes in migraineurs with recurrent vertigo. No direct pathophysiological link between migraine and BPPV has yet been established; comorbidity seems to affect clinical features in a sub-population of patients and make BPPV more debilitating.</td>

	<td>Comorbidity between vestibular and psychiatric disorders in predisposed individuals is underestimated, untreated, and may result in chronicization and poor quality of life. There are few studies concerning the type and the prevalence of psychiatric-psychosomatic distress in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The aim of this study was to evaluate psychiatric-psychosomatic comorbidities, in particular anxiety, depression, somatization symptoms, and alexithymia, in a group of BPPV patients compared with healthy subjects, and according to gender. Case-control study comparing 92 BPPV patients recruited at the ENT Unit of Modena General Hospital between November 2007 and December 2010, and 141 healthy controls. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) were used to perform psychometric assessment. BPPV patients scored higher than controls, with statistical significance, at BDI, BSI somatization, anxiety, and phobic anxiety subscales, and STAI state anxiety; a larger proportion of BPPV patients suffered from clinically significant BDI depressive symptomatology; DCPR disease phobia, functional somatic symptoms secondary to a psychiatric disorder, and demoralization were more common among BPPV subjects. High levels of symptomatology were still found among BPPV female patients, but not among males, even after controlling for symptom severity. Affective symptomatology, such as depression, demoralization, phobia and anxiety, and somatization, were significantly prevalent in BPPV patients, and female gender may be a predisposing factor.</td>

	<td>To systematically review and discuss the main pathologies associated with vertigo and dizziness in children, paying particular attention to recent advances in diagnosis and therapy. One appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles dealing with the topics mentioned above. A cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles found using the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. A non-comparative meta-analysis concerning the rate of singular vertiginous forms was performed. Ten articles were identified comprising a total of 724 subjects. Overall, the articles we analyzed indicated benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (18.7%) and migraine-associated vertigo (17.6%) as the two main entities connected with vertigo and dizziness in children. Head trauma (14%) was the third most common cause of vertigo. The mean (95% CI) rate of every vertiginous form was also calculated in relation to the nine studies analyzed with vestibular migraine (27.82%), benign paroxysmal vertigo (15.68%) and vestibular neuritis (9.81%) being the three most common forms. There appeared to be a paucity of recent literature concerning the development of new diagnostic methods and therapies. On the basis of the literature study, when evaluating a young patient with vertigo and dizziness, the otolaryngologist should be aware that, in children, these symptoms are often connected to different pathologies in comparison to the entities observed in the adult population.</td>

	<td>There are few conditions in neurology that are diagnosed with such ease and certainty as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Repositioning maneuvers are highly effective in treating BPPV, inexpensive, and easy to apply. Surgery has a very minor role in the management of BPPV, and although medications may transiently ameliorate symptoms, they do not treat the underlying process. There is good evidence to support treatment of posterior canal BPPV with Epley or Semont maneuvers and horizontal canal BPPV with Gufoni maneuvers or BBQ roll (also known as Lempert 360 roll or log roll); and weaker evidence for head hanging maneuvers in the least common anterior canal variant. Since the therapeutic efficacy amongst maneuvers for each canal is comparable, the choice of treatment is generally based on clinician preference, complexity of the maneuvers themselves, poor treatment response to specific maneuvers, and musculoskeletal considerations such as arthritic changes and range of motion of the cervical spine. Treating posterior canal BPPV with Epley or Semont manuevers is comparable as far as efficacy and the ease with which maneuvers are performed. For horizontal canal BPPV, the Gufoni maneuver is easier to perform compared to the BBQ roll, as it requires that the clinician only identify the side of weaker nystagmus (regardless of whether it's geotropic or apogeotropic) and not necessarily the side involved. Anterior canal BPPV is rare and generally short-lived, but there is weak evidence that deep head hanging and a variety of eponymous maneuvers may hasten recovery. The advantage of deep head hanging maneuvers is that they can be effectively performed without knowledge of the side involved.</td>

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness count among the most frequent symptoms in outpatient practices. Although most vestibular disorders are manageable, they are often under- and misdiagnosed in primary care. This may result in prolonged absence from work, increased resource use and, potentially, in chronification. Reliable information on health services utilization of patients with vertigo in primary care is scarce. Retrospective cohort study in patients referred to a tertiary care balance clinic. Included patients had a confirmed diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Menière's disease (MD), vestibular paroxysmia (VP), bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), vestibular migraine (VM), or psychogenic vertigo (PSY). All previous diagnostic and therapeutic measures prior to the first visit to the clinic were recorded. 2,374 patients were included (19.7 % BPPV, 12.7 % MD, 5.8 % VP, 7.2 % BVP, 14.1 % VM, 40.6 % PSY), 61.3 % with more than two consultations. Most frequent diagnostic measures were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 76.2 %, 71 % in BPPV) and electrocardiography (53.5 %). Most frequent therapies were medication (61.0 %) and physical therapy (41.3 %). 37.3 % had received homoeopathic medication (39 % in BPPV), and 25.9 % were treated with betahistine (20 % in BPPV). Patients had undergone on average 3.2 (median 3.0, maximum 6) diagnostic measures, had received 1.8 (median 2.0, maximum 8) therapies and 1.8 (median 1.0, maximum 17) different drugs. Diagnostic subgroups differed significantly regarding number of diagnostic measures, therapies and drugs. The results emphasize the need for establishing systematic training to improve oto-neurological skills in primary care services not specialized on the treatment of dizzy patients.</td>

	<td>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2002 and previously updated in 2004 and 2007.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres, including the Epley manoeuvre. To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV. We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 January 2014. Randomised controlled trials of the Epley manoeuvre versus placebo, no treatment or other active treatment for adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). The primary outcome of interest was complete resolution of vertigo symptoms. Secondary outcomes were conversion of a 'positive' Dix-Hallpike test to a 'negative' Dix-Hallpike test and adverse effects of treatment. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 11 trials in the review with a total of 745 patients.Five studies compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre, three against other particle repositioning manoeuvres (Semont, Brandt-Daroff and Gans) and three against a control (no treatment, medication only, postural restriction). Patients were treated in hospital otolaryngology departments in eight studies and family practices in two studies. All patients were adults aged 18 to 90 years old, with a sex ratio of 1:1.5 male to female.There was a low risk of overall bias in the studies included. All studies were randomised with six applying sealed envelope or external allocation techniques. Eight of the trials blinded the assessors to the participants' treatment group and data on all outcomes for all participants were reported in eight of the 11 studies. Complete resolution of vertigo Complete resolution of vertigo occurred significantly more often in the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (odds ratio (OR) 4.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62 to 7.44; five studies, 273 participants); the proportion of patients resolving increased from 21% to 56%. None of the trials comparing Epley versus other particle repositioning manoeuvres reported vertigo resolution as an outcome. Conversion of Dix-Hallpike positional test result from positive to negative Conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test significantly favoured the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (OR 9.62, 95% CI 6.0 to 15.42; eight studies, 507 participants). There was no difference when comparing the Epley with the Semont manoeuvre (two studies, 117 participants) or the Epley with the Gans manoeuvre (one study, 58 participants). In one study a single Epley treatment was more effective than a week of three times daily Brandt-Daroff exercises (OR 12.38, 95% CI 4.32 to 35.47; 81 participants). Adverse effects Adverse effects were infrequently reported. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. Rates of nausea during the repositioning manoeuvre varied from 16.7% to 32%. Some patients were unable to tolerate the manoeuvres because of cervical spine problems. There is evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe, effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, based on the results of 11, mostly small, randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow-up. There is a high recurrence rate of BPPV after treatment (36%). Outcomes for Epley manoeuvre treatment are comparable to treatment with Semont and Gans manoeuvres, but superior to Brandt-Daroff exercises.</td>

	<td>Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of global cerebral hypoperfusion. It is generally benign but may be a sign of pathology. The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency of syncope due to cardiac, neurocardiogenic, neurologic, situational, psychiatric, and other causes and make a differential diagnosis of syncope types according to detailed medical history and further investigations. We examined prospectively 268 children presented to pediatric polyclinics as well as cardiology and neurology departments (age range, 1-18 years) with a primary complaint of syncope for the study. Cardiac syncope was diagnosed in 12 patients, neurocardiogenic syncope in 232, neurologic syncope in 9, psychiatric syncope in 9, situational in 4, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in 2. The neurologic syncope group consists of patients diagnosed with epilepsy after evaluation. Eight patients in the cardiac syncope group were found to have diseases such as long QT syndrome, and the remaining patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and a second-degree heart block that can cause sudden death. In conclusion, syncope is a common problem in childhood that requires hospitalization. Because it may be the first finding of an underlying malignant cardiac or neurologic disease, clinicians must be very careful during medical evaluation. An electrocardiogram and a medical history including the details of the event, chronic diseases, and familial diseases are among the most important steps for the right diagnosis and prognosis. Instead of a routine procedure, further diagnostic workup should be directed according to medical history for high yield. Convulsive movements may be defined in all types of syncope related with cerebral hypoxia, and this may lead to a misdiagnosis of seizure by the clinician. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common form of vertigo and is characterized by episodic dizziness related to changes in head position relative to gravity. BPPV symptoms can be similar to those of central nervous system vascular diseases. The association between BPPV and ischemic stroke has not yet been investigated. The study cohort consisted of patients who were diagnosed with BPPV at least twice in the previous year as an outpatient or for whom BPPV was the primary diagnosis as an inpatient (n = 4104). An age- and gender-matched sample that excluded patients with a diagnosis of any form of vertigo was selected as the comparison cohort (n = 8397). All cases were followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2008. The demographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, and use of medications in both groups were investigated using chi-square tests. A stratified analysis of stroke risk factors was performed to determine the hazard ratios of BPPV. During the 9-year follow-up period, 185 of the 4104 (4.5%) subjects with BPPV and 240 of the 8379 (2.9%) subjects without BPPV developed ischemic strokes. The crude hazard ratio of BPPV for developing ischemic strokes was 1.708. After adjusting for stroke risk factors, the risk of developing ischemic strokes in BPPV subjects was 1.415-fold higher than the risk among those without BPPV (confidence interval: 1.162-1.732, p = 0.001). After a subgroup analysis stratified according to stroke risk factors, BPPV remained independently associated with a higher risk of developing future ischemic stroke. We conclude that BPPV is independently associated with a risk of subsequent ischemic stroke. More aggressive control of modifiable risk factors for ischemic strokes should be conducted in patients with BPPV. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the commonest cause of dizziness. It is characterised by brief episodes of vertigo and imbalance with nystagmus. The direction of nystagmus allows the identification of the culprit semicircular canal. As it is readily treatable--and often curable--BPPV should not be missed. Although recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by movement suggest BPPV, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. Here we review the diagnostic manoeuvres required to diagnose BPPV, and the various repositioning manoeuvres for treating different types of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common reason patients present to doctors, but effective diagnostic tests and treatments for dizziness are underused. The internet is a way to disseminate medical information and is emerging as an intervention platform. The objective of this study was to describe internet searches for dizziness terms to assess the possible consumer demand for internet-based dizziness diagnostic and treatment tools. Google AdWords and Google Insights for Search were used for keyword search data on the following generic terms: vertigo, dizzy, dizziness, lightheaded, and lightheadedness. Data collected included keyword ideas (i.e., additional keywords identified by Google as being related search terms), global and US only monthly search frequencies, as well as trends in top searches related to dizziness terms from 2004 to 2012. Keywords suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or BPPV processes were identified. Of the five generic dizziness terms, vertigo had the most global searches per month (1.83 million) and lightheadedness had the least (90,500). Four BPPV-specific terms had more than 100,000 global searches per month. Three BPPV terms ("positional vertigo," "benign vertigo," and "benign positional vertigo") have been in the list of top searches related to vertigo every quarter since 2004. Substantial demand exists for dizziness information via the internet. Future studies should seek to better characterize the population seeking this information. The magnitude of this potential demand suggests that validated and tested diagnostic and treatment tools could contribute to healthcare efficiencies and patient outcomes.</td>

	<td>Though benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder causing positional vertigo, patients with typical positional vertigo in which the findings of positional nystagmus do not meet the diagnostic criteria for BPPV are often encountered in the clinic. Recently a concept of the light cupula was introduced, which accounts for some of positional vertigo. Under a normal condition in which the specific gravity of the cupula is same as that of the surrounding endolymph, semicircular canals (SCCs) are not influenced by the gravity. The light cupula, which indicates cupula with lower specific gravity than the surrounding endolymph, is characterized by persistent geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN) without latency on the supine head-roll test and the presence of a null plane. Unless the duration and pattern of positional nystagmus are carefully examined, the light cupula can be misdiagnosed as other types of BPPV. We present a patient with light cupula on the right side who reported recurrent episodes of positional vertigo and had been diagnosed as BPPV with multiple canal involvement (posterior and lateral SCCs) on the opposite side. In this study, we present the mechanism of typical positional nystagmus patterns in patients with light cupula involving all of the unilateral SCCs, and discuss the possible causes of misdiagnosis of the light cupula. </td>

Individual randomized controlled trial. One hundred fifty patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who achieved successful CRPs on initial visit participated in this study. Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) questionnaires were completed before CRPs. All study populations were divided into three groups after successful CRPs on the initial visit day: the medication (V) group (treated with a vestibular suppressant [dimenhydrinate 50 mg per day]), the placebo (P) group, and the no medication (N) group. One week after successful CRPs, residual symptoms were checked and repeated DHI questionnaires were completed to compare residual symptoms. Among the 138 patients who did not show positional nystagmus at follow-up, 67 (48.5%) complained of residual symptoms. The presence of residual symptoms was more prevalent in the P and N group compared with the V group (P = .035, P = .017, respectively). The most frequent residual symptom was lightheadedness (n = 42). Moreover, in the V group, lightheadedness was significantly reduced compared with the P group (P = .029). However, in the analysis of DHI, total and subscale scores did not differ across the three groups before or after successful CRP. Vestibular suppressants significantly reduced residual symptoms compared to both placebo and no medication after CRP. However, there was no significant reduction in DHI score compared with the control group, suggesting that the residual symptoms could not be evaluated by DHI score alone.</td>

	<td>The etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is still elusive even though detached otolith particles from the utricular macula are generally thought to be responsible for the pathogenesis of BPPV. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), of which the etiology is also idiopathic in most cases, may accompany concurrent BPPV. This uncommon condition of concurrent BPPV with SSNHL has been assumptively explained as selective damage of the cochlea and the utricle due to viral neurolabyrinthitis. Recently, radiological evidences that inner ear hemorrhage is observed in patients with SSNHL accompanied by severe vertigo have been reported. The basic hypothesis for this study is that blood debris in the endolymphatic fluid due to inner ear hemorrhage is one of the causes of concurrent posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) BPPV in patient with ipsilateral SSNHL. In this report, we will outline the clinical findings of 4 patients with PSCC BPPV with SSNHL, and present an experimental results using whole blood in artificial endolymph to evaluate the hypothesis. </td>

We conducted a prospective case series study in 19 patients with persistent geotropic DCPN. Positional nystagmus during the bow and lean test and the supine head roll test was analyzed using videonystagmography. All of the 19 patients showed persistent geotropic DCPN without latency. A null plane in which the nystagmus ceases was identified in all of 19 patients, and the intensity of nystagmus was stronger on one side in13 patients (68%) on supine head roll test. Overall, the affected side could be identified in 18 patients (95%). About 14.2% (19 of 134) of patients with geotropic DCPN could be diagnosed as having light cupula in the horizontal semicircular canal. The patients with light cupula show persistent geotropic DCPN without latency. Affected side(s) can be determined by the direction and intensity of the characteristic positional nystagmus and the side of the null plane. The pathophysiology and treatment of light cupula still remain to be elucidated.</td>

	<td>To investigate whether residual dizziness after successful treatment in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was associated with autonomic dysfunction. Fifty-eight consecutive patients with BPPV who had successful canal repositioning procedures (CRPs) and showed no nystagmus or positional vertigo at the next follow-up visit were enrolled and divided into two groups with and without residual dizziness. We performed a standardized autonomic function test. Of the 58 patients, 25 (43%) complained of residual dizziness after successful CRPs, in which postural lightheadedness when righting from sitting, or short-lasting nonspecific dizziness that occurred during head movement or walking were common complaints. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) occurred in 11 patients (19%). Incidence of OH was significantly higher in patients with residual dizziness at the next follow-up than those without residual dizziness (40% and 3%, p=0.000). Compared to patients without residual dizziness, patients with residual dizziness had larger falls in systolic BP during the valsalva maneuver and head-up tilt test. However, cardiovagal parasympathetic function was not different between the patients with and without residual dizziness. In BPPV, residual dizziness after successful treatment may be associated with sympathoneural autonomic dysfunction. This investigation could be useful in understanding the mechanism of residual dizziness in patients with BPPV.</td>

	<td>Nystagmus can occur spontaneously from multiple causes. Direction-changing positional nystagmus on the supine roll test is a characteristic clinical feature in horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. One of several mechanisms of spontaneous nystagmus is plugging of the otoconia, which has been described as a canalith jam. We evaluated a 52-year-old woman with a history of geotropic variant of horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo on the right side who had been treated with a modified Lempert maneuver 3 months earlier. The patient had persistent spontaneous nystagmus, despite a positional change after the canalith repositioning procedure. A bithermal caloric test result demonstrated unilateral canal paresis on the right side. The following day, the patient's symptoms and nystagmus had subsided. On a repeated bithermal caloric test, a normal response was demonstrated on both sides. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case that shows on video persistent nystagmus findings consistent with a canalith jam. We discuss a possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon.</td>

	<td>Direction changing horizontal positional nystagmus can be observed in a variety of central and peripheral vestibular disorders. We tested sixty subjects with horizontal positional nystagmus and vertigo on the Epley Omniax(®) rotator. Monocular video recordings were performed with the right or left ear down, in the supine and prone positions. Nystagmus slow-phase velocity (SPV) was plotted as a function of time. Thirty-one subjects diagnosed with horizontal canalolithiasis had paroxysmal horizontal geotropic nystagmus with the affected ear down (onset 0.8 ± 1 s, range 0-4.9 s, duration 11.7-47.9 s, peak SPV 79 ± 67°/s). The SPV peaked at 5-20 s and declined to 0 by 60 s; at 40 s from onset, the average SPV was 1.8 % of the peak. Nine subjects diagnosed with cupulolithiasis had persistent apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus (onset 0.7 ± 1.4 s, range 0-4.3 s). Peak SPV was 54.2 ± 31.8°/s and 26.6 ± 12.2°/s with unaffected and affected ears down, respectively. At 40 s, the average SPV had decayed to only 81 % (unaffected ear down) and 65 % (affected ear down) of the peak. Twenty subjects were diagnosed with disorders other than benign positional vertigo (BPV) [vestibular migraine (VM), Ménière's Disease, vestibular schwannoma, unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular loss]. Subjects with VM (n = 13) had persistent geotropic or apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus. On average, at 40 s from nystagmus onset, the SPV was 61 % of the peak. Two patients with Ménière's Disease had persistent apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus; the peak SPV at 40 s ranged between 28.6 and 49.5 % of the peak. Symptomatic horizontal positional nystagmus can be observed in canalolithiasis, cupulolithiasis and diverse central and peripheral vestibulopathies; its temporal and intensity profile could be helpful in the separation of these entities.</td>

Out of 14 institutes which participated in this study, 5 institutes had previous experience of the Epley but not the Semont maneuver and the other 9 had previous experience of both maneuvers. Each maneuver was repeated twice if there was still positional vertigo or nystagmus on day 0, and the presence of nystagmus and vertigo on positional testing were evaluated immediately, 1 day, and 1 week after treatment. After the first maneuver, the Epley group showed a significantly higher resolution rate of positional nystagmus than the Semont or sham groups (63.9, 37.5, and 38.7%, respectively). After the second maneuver, the resolution rate (83.3%) of the Epley group was significantly higher than that (51.6%) of the sham group. At 1 day and 1 week after treatment, the resolution rate of the Epley group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. Similar results were seen for the resolution of positional vertigo. The Epley maneuver showed persistent resolution rates of positional vertigo and nystagmus without a fatigue phenomenon. The Epley maneuver was significantly more effective per maneuver than Semont or sham maneuvers for the short-term treatment of posterior canal BPPV. The Semont maneuver showed a higher success rate than the sham maneuver, but it was not significantly different.</td>

	<td>To determine the characteristics and diagnostic value of pseudo-spontaneous and head-shaking nystagmus (HSN) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the horizontal semicircular canal (HC-BPPV). Retrospective case series review. After excluding 19 patients with canal paresis, abnormal head impulse test, recent history of peripheral or central vestibular disorders, or poor cooperation, we retrospectively recruited 127 patients with HC-BPPV from January 2009 to July 2012. The patients included 69 geotropic and 58 apogeotropic types. We analyzed the pattern of pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus and HSN according to the lesion side. Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus was observed in 87 (87/127, 68.5%) patients, both in geotropic (46/69, 66.7%) and apogeotropic (41/58, 70.7%) types without difference in the prevalence between the types (p = 0.627). Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus beat more to the lesion side in apogeotropic type (28/41, 68.3%, p = 0.028) but in either direction without directional preponderance in geotropic type (p = 0.659). Of the 90 patients who underwent horizontal head-shaking, 27 (30.0%) showed HSN that was more common in apogeotropic than in geotropic type (22/44 [50.0%] versus 5/46 [10.9%], p < 0.001). Patients with apogeotropic HC-BPPV showed predominantly contralesional HSN (19/22 [86.4%], p = 0.001), whereas patients with geotropic type did not show any directional preponderance of HSN (contralesional in 2 and ipsilesional in 3). HSN is more common and mostly contralesional in apogeotropic HC-BPPV. HSN may be a lateralizing sign in apogeotropic HC-BPPV. Different prevalence and patterns of HSN in apogeotropic and geotropic HC-BPPV suggest dissimilar cupular dynamics in those disorders.</td>

	<td>The clinical features and treatment outcomes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are known to be different depending on the type of and involved canal. This difference could be due to differences in the functional change of the otolith organ. Case series. Forty-nine patients were diagnosed to primary BPPV; 18 were categorized as posterior canal canalolithiasis (PC canalolithiasis), and 31 were categorized as horizontal canal (HC) BPPV with canalolithiasis or cupulolithiasis (HC canalolithiasis or HC cupulolithiasis). Diagnostic interventions to measure vestibular functions were performed such as electronystagmography (ENG), videonystagmography (VNG), and static and dynamic subjective visual vertical (SVV). BPPV was confirmed with nystagmus during positioning/positional test under ENG and VNG. Static SVV was recorded with a light-emitting diode (LED) bar located in front of the patients before eccentric rotation and dynamic SVV was recorded during eccentric rotation with the LED bar. SVV angles were read by the examiner and analyzed. The measured values were compared to those of normal controls and each other. Dynamic SVV toward the lesion side in all subtypes of BPPV were significantly different from those of the controls; HC cupulolithiasis showed significantly lower values than those of PC canalolithiasis and HC canalolithiasis. HC cupulolithiasis shows a lesser degree of utricular dysfunction compared with other subtypes. It could postulate the difference of pathophysiology between canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis. 4.</td>

This population was made up of 731 patients--254 men (34.7%) and 477 women (65.3%). During their consultations, all of these patients were evaluated simultaneously by an ENT surgeon and a neurologist. We were able to identify the cause of dizziness in 620 of these patients (84.8%). The two most common causes were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which was found in 202 patients (27.6%), and hyperventilation/anxiety, which was diagnosed in 112 patients (15.3%). Based on our findings, we conclude that the cause of dizziness can be established in the vast majority of elderly patients. We also compare our findings in these older patients with those of a group of 2,556 younger patients who were seen at our hospital and with the findings reported in other studies.</td>

This study showed differences in sensorimotor disturbances between the two groups, particularly in the control of head and eye movements and cervical proprioception. Patients with cervicogenic dizziness were more likely to (1) have a sensation of drunkenness and lightheadedness, (2) have pain induced during the physical examination of the upper cervical vertebrae, (3) have an elevated joint position error of 4.5 degrees during the cervical relocation test, and (4) exhibit more than 2 degrees per second nystagmus during the cervical rotation test.

	<td>Aerospace environments commonly expose pilots to vibration and sustained acceleration, alone and in combination. Of 16 experimental research participants, 3 reported symptoms of vertigo and signs of torsional nystagmus during or shortly following exposure to sustained chest-to-spine (+3.8 Gx) acceleration (G loading) and chest-to-spine (0.5 g(x)) vibration in the 8-16 Hz band. Two of the participants reported intermittent vertigo for up to 2 wk, were diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and were treated successfully with the Epley Maneuver. On a follow-up survey, a third participant reported transient BPPV-like vertigo, which resolved spontaneously. The follow-up survey also prompted participants to self-report other effects following research protocol exposure to vibration and G loading, revealing details about other minor and transient, but more common, effects that resolved within 3 h. Our studies indicated a significantly elevated incidence of BPPV following exposure to vibration plus G loading compared to vibration alone that was positively correlated with participant age. One mechanism for the rolling sensation in BPPV involves broken or dislodged otoconia floating within one of the posterior semicircular canals, making the canal gravity-sensitive. Our observations highlight a heretofore unforeseen risk of otolith damage sustained during launch, undetectable in space, potentially contributing to vertigo and perceived tumbling upon re-entry from microgravity.</td>

	<td>The head-impulse test (HIT) is an important test for examining unilateral vestibular hypofunction. The new video-head-impulse test (vHIT) is more sensitive and specific than the clinical bedside-head-impulse test (bHIT). Alternatively, one can test for vestibular hypofunction with the caloric irrigation test. Various studies showed that both tests may not always identify vestibular hypofunction; instead, the results of the tests might be contradictory. To evaluate the diagnostic value of these tests, we routinely measured patients exhibiting vertigo or dizziness at our community hospital with bithermal caloric irrigation, the bHIT and the vHIT. Only those patients (n = 172) with a pathological caloric irrigation test of more than 25 % unilateral weakness in the Jongkee's formula were included. Out of these patients, 41 % had a pathologic vHIT. Among the subgroup with acute symptoms (symptom onset within 5 days), 63 % had a pathological video-head-impulse, whereas only 33 % of the non-acute group (symptom onset more than 5 days) tested pathological. A pathological HIT depended on the disease stage, the amount of unilateral weakness in caloric examination and on the test itself.</td>

In this sense CRMs under video-Frenzel are informative for the immediate follow-up, although not related to the degree of disability or emotional distress. Still, attention should be given to psychological assistance even in cases of clinically cured benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The aim of the study was to highlight the prognostic value of nystagmus in CRMs for BPPV and its relevance for emotional and patient-perceived disability. A group of 57 patients were selected from 3 balance disorders centers. CRMs were performed under video-Frenzel control. Assessment of patient disability and positional nystagmus was performed 2 months later. Emotional (Cuestionario de Impacto Emocional del Vértigo, CIEV) and quality of life (Dizziness Handicap Inventory, DHI) impact were evaluated. The posterior semicircular canal (SCC) was affected in 84.2% of cases, the horizontal SCC in 10.5%, and the anterior SCC in 5.1%. Appropriate CRMs were performed. ON was present in 67% of cases. Overall resolution after the first treatment was achieved in 56% of cases. With ON present the success rate was 63% and when not observed the rate was 42%. DHI or CIEV scores were not significantly different when comparing the presence vs absence of ON. In nine patients (16%) an abnormal CIEV score was observed after treatment, even though a cured status was achieved in six of these nine patients.</td>

	<td>To determine the importance of accurate topological diagnostics of the otolith and the differentiation of certain clinical forms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A prospective study was conducted at the County General Hospital Vukovar in the period from January 2011 till January 2012. A total of 81 patients with BPPV, 59 females (72.84%) and 22 (27.16%) males (p less than 0.001), mean age 60.1 (± 12.1) were examined. The diagnosis was confirmed and documented by videonystagmography (VNG). The disability due to disease and risk of falling were monitored by filling in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the repositioning treatment. In 79 (97.3%) patients posterior semicircular canal was affected, and in a small number of patients, two (2.47%) the lateral one. After the repositioning procedures were performed, there was a significant reduction or complete elimination of symptoms in the majority of subjects, 76 (93.82%). The median total DHI sum amounted to 50.5 (± 22.2) at the beginning and 20.4 (± 18.5) at the end of the study (p less than 0.00). Similarly, the results of ABC questionnaires at the beginning of the study demonstrated a result of 59.2% (± 22.4%), and at the end of the treatment the average result of examinees was significantly higher, 84.9% (± 15.2%) (p less than 0.00). Although a subjectively positive Dix-Hallpike or a "supine roll" test is sufficient for the diagnosis of BPPV, it is necessary perform the VNG as well in order to precisely determine the exact localization of the otolith, so that an appropriate repositioning procedure can be applied.</td>

Undiagnosed BPPV has been associated with depression, falls and ADL limitations. This case study describes the diagnostic process and management of BPPV for a 65-year-old patient with a primary complaint of chronic low back pain (LBP) in an outpatient orthopedic physical therapy setting. Following routine screening performed on initial evaluation, the patient was educated about examination findings that indicated the potential for BPPV and given the option to proceed with further assessment or defer until LBP was under control. The patient attended 16 visits over the course of care and the complaint of vertigo, described as a true spinning sensation, was assessed further on the visit 5. Continued assessment confirmed BPPV and the canalith repositioning procedure was administered. Following positive response to this intervention, the maneuver was re-administered on visit 6. Complete resolution of symptoms was reported on visit 7 and for the remainder of physical therapy services over the following month. Physical therapists may play a vital role in reducing healthcare expenses associated with cost to arrive at the diagnosis of BPPV, as well as improving the quality of life and safety of the older adult population affected by BPPV.</td>

	<td>Introduction Vertigo can be due to a variety of central and peripheral causes. The relative incidence of central causes is underestimated. This may have an important impact of the patients' management and prognosis. Objective The objective of this work is to determine the incidence of central vestibular disorders in patients presenting to a vestibular unit in a tertiary referral academic center. It also aims at determining the best strategy to increase the diagnostic yield of the patients' visit. Methods This is a prospective observational study on 100 consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of vestibular dysfunction. All patients completed a structured questionnaire and received bedside and vestibular examination and neuroimaging as required. Results There were 69 women and 31 men. Their ages ranged between 28 and 73 (mean 42.48 years). Provisional videonystagmography (VNG) results were: 40% benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 23% suspicious of central causes, 18% undiagnosed, 15% Meniere disease, and 4% vestibular neuronitis. Patients with an unclear diagnosis or central features (41) had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Doppler studies. Combining data from history, VNG, and imaging studies, 23 patients (23%) were diagnosed as having a central vestibular lesion (10 with generalized ischemia/vertebra basilar insufficiency, 4 with multiple sclerosis, 4 with migraine vestibulopathy, 4 with phobic postural vertigo, and 1 with hyperventilation-induced nystagmus). Conclusions Combining a careful history with clinical examination, VNG, MRI, and Doppler studies decreases the number of undiagnosed cases and increases the detection of possible central lesions. </td>

	<td>It has been noted that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may be associated with certain disorders and medical procedures. However, most studies to date were done in Europe, and epidemiological data on the United States (US) population are scarce. Gender-based information is even rarer. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess the relative prevalence of each type of association based solely on literature data, because different comorbidities were reported by various groups from different countries using different patient populations and possibly different inclusion/exclusion criteria. In this study, we surveyed and analyzed a large adult BPPV population (n = 1,360 surveyed, 227 completed, most of which were recurrent BPPV cases) from Omaha, NE, US, and its vicinity, all diagnosed at Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) over the past decade using established and consistent diagnostic criteria. In addition, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients' diagnostic records (n = 1,377, with 1,360 adults and 17 children). The following comorbidities were found to be significantly more prevalent in the BPPV population when compared to the age- and gender-matched general population: ear/hearing problems, head injury, thyroid problems, allergies, high cholesterol, headaches, and numbness/paralysis. There were gender differences in the comorbidities. In addition, familial predisposition was fairly common among the participants. Thus, the data confirm some previously reported comorbidities, identify new ones (hearing loss, thyroid problems, high cholesterol, and numbness/paralysis), and suggest possible predisposing and triggering factors and events for BPPV.</td>

We analyzed 1,377 BPPV patients and surveyed 935 women from this group-all diagnosed at the Boys Town National Research Hospital in the last decade. A detailed age and sex distribution analysis of BPPV onset showed that aging had a profound impact on BPPV occurrence in both sexes, and that perimenopausal women were especially susceptible to BPPV (3.2:1 female-to-male ratio). The latter is a novel finding and was confirmed by a direct survey of female BPPV patients (168 participated). In addition, there was a pronounced female preponderance (6.8:1 female-to-male ratio) in BPPV in the teenage group despite its low prevalence in this age group. Data suggest that hormonal fluctuations (especially during menopause) may increase the tendency to develop BPPV.</td>

	<td>Lateralization of horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV) is very important for successful repositioning. The directions of lying-down nystagmus (LDN) and head-bending nystagmus (HBN) have been used as ancillary findings to identify the affected sites. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the lateralizing values of LDN and HBN using clinical and laboratory findings for lateralizing probabilities in patients with HSC-BPPV. For 50 HSC-BPPV patients with asymmetric direction-changing horizontal nystagmus (DCHN) during the head-rolling test (HRT) using Frenzel goggles, the directions of LDN and HBN were evaluated and compared to those determined by video-oculography. Directional LDN was defined as the contralesional direction of nystagmus in geotropic types and the ipsilesional direction in apogeotropic types. Directional HBN was defined as the opposite direction relative to directional LDN. We also analyzed LDN and HBN in 14 patients with a history of ipsilesional peripheral vestibulopathy, caloric abnormality or conversion from other types of BPPV (such as probable localized HSC-BPPV, pro-BPPV). LDN and HBN were seen in 68% (34/50) and 76% (38/50) of patients, respectively. Of these, 19 (55.9%), and 28 (73.7%) patients showed directional LDN and HBN, respectively. The proportion of patients with directional LDN and HBN was much smaller among the pro-BPPV patients (4/12 for LDN, 3/10 for HBN). LDN and HBN did not seem to predict lateralization in patients with HSC-BPPV. To improve the prediction of lateralization of HSC-BPPV, it is necessary to modify the maneuvers used to elicit LDN or HBN, especially in cases of symmetric DCHN during HRT.</td>

	<td>Using American bullfrog models under normal conditions and under vestibular dysfunction, we investigated whether mechanical vibration applied to the ear could induce otoconial dislodgement. Vibration was applied to the labyrinth of the bullfrog using a surgical drill. The time required for the otoconia to dislodge from the utricular macula was measured. Vestibular dysfunction models were created and the dislodgement time was compared with the normal models. The morphology of the utricular macula was also investigated. In the normal models, the average time for otoconial dislodgement to occur was 7 min and 36 s; in the vestibular dysfunction models, it was 2 min and 11 s. Pathological investigation revealed that the sensory hairs of the utricle were reduced in number and that the sensory cells became atrophic in the vestibular dysfunction models. The otoconia of the utricle were dislodged into the semicircular canal after applying vibration. The time to dislodgement was significantly shorter in the vestibular dysfunction models than in the normal models; the utricular macula sustained significant morphological damage.</td>

	<td>Serum biomarkers detect the earliest events in disease, monitor management, and provide insight into disease pathogenesis. At this time, there are no biomarkers available for otologic disorders. Otolin-1 is a scaffolding protein exclusively expressed in otoconia and cells of the vestibule and the cochlea; therefore, it may be a biomarker candidate for assessing the health of the inner ear. As a proof of concept, we used serum samples from controls without otologic history and subjects with a history of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for otolin-1, and measured the optical density of the substrate. Otolin-1 was detectable and quantifiable in all subjects, indicating that this inner ear protein crosses the blood-labyrinthine barrier. Furthermore, subjects with BPPV had significantly higher levels, with about one-third being above the control range. This promising preliminary result suggests that inner ear-specific proteins have the potential to serve as biomarkers for otologic disease processes. </td>

	<td>The function of all the semicircular canals in patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in whom otoconial debris is located in the superior semicircular canal (SSC) is normal. BPPV of SSC is an infrequent entity in which otoconial debris evokes vertigo and nystagmus in the head-hanging position and during anterior flexion of the patient. We studied the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in 12 patients with this particular type of BPPV. The reflex was evoked by rapid head impulses in the plane of the three semicircular canals in the affected and the normal ear. The reflex was evaluated with a video system that analyzes the head and eye velocity: the gain (the relation between both magnitudes) was the objective measure. The mean gain of VOR was within normal limits for the six semicircular canals and there were no significant differences between the same canals on each side of patients with BPPV in whom canalolithiasis was located in the SSC. However, gain asymmetry was different for each pair of canals.</td>

	<td>A transalveolar approach for sinus floor elevation with subsequent placement of dental implants was first suggested by Tatum in 1986. In 1994, Summers described a different transalveolar approach using a set of tapered osteotomes with increasing diameters. The transalveolar approach of sinus floor elevation, also referred to as 'osteotome sinus floor elevation', the 'Summers technique' or the 'Crestal approach', may be considered as being more conservative and less invasive than the conventional lateral window approach. This is reflected by the fact that more than nine out of 10 patients who experienced the surgical procedure would be willing to undergo it again. The main indication for transalveolar sinus floor elevation is reduced residual bone height, which does not allow standard implant placement. Contraindications for transalveolar sinus floor elevation may be intra-oral, local or medical. The surgical approach utilized over the last two decades is the technique described by Summers, with or without minor modifications. The surgical care after implant placement using the osteotome technique is similar to the surgical care after standard implant placement. The patients are usually advised to take antibiotic prophylaxis and to utilize antiseptic rinses. The main complications reported after performing a transalveolar sinus floor elevation were perforation of the Schneiderian membrane in 3.8% of patients and postoperative infections in 0.8% of patients. Other complications reported were postoperative hemorrhage, nasal bleeding, blocked nose, hematomas and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Whether it is necessary to use grafting material to maintain space for new bone formation after elevating the sinus membrane utilizing the osteotome technique is still controversial. Positive outcomes have been reported with and without using grafting material. A prospective study, evaluating both approaches, concluded that significantly more bone gain was seen when grafting material was used (4.1 mm mean bone gain compared with 1.7 mm when no grafting material was utilized). In a systematic review, including 19 studies reporting on 4388 implants inserted using the transalveolar sinus floor elevation technique, the 3-year implant survival rate was 92.8% (95% confidence interval: 87.4-96.0%). Furthermore, a subject-based analysis of the same material revealed an annual failure rate of 3.7%. Hence, one in 10 subjects experienced implant loss over 3 years. Several of the included studies demonstrated that transalveolar sinus floor elevation was most predictable when the residual alveolar bone height was ≥ 5 mm and the sinus floor anatomy was relatively flat. </td>

	<td>To compare the clinical characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) between the elderly and the younger patients. The medical records of BPPV patients with positive testing result on the Dix-Hallpike or supine roll test between January 2002 and December 2012 at Songklanagarind hospital, Thailand were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 951 BPPV patients, 595 patients were in the younger group (age < or =60-year-old, mean age = 46.9+/-8.9 years) and 356 patients were in the elderly group (age >60-year-old, mean age = 69.3+/-6. 7years). The most common etiology of BPPV was idiopathic. No significant difference was found regarding gender and semicircular canals that were involved in both groups. The most involved semicircular canal was the posterior canal. The most common described symptom of BPPV was vertigo. Patients in the elderly group were less likely to describe vertigo as the presenting symptom of BPPV compared to those in the younger group (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0. 12-0.41; p< 0. 001). The elderly group usually complained of imbalance and dizziness (OR = 15.83; 95% CI, 8.7-28.8; p<0. 001 and OR = 10.12; 95% CI, 5.23-19.59; p<0. 001, respectively). The duration of the symptom before diagnosis was longer in the elderly, when compared to the younger group (30 days, median; IQR = 7, 61 versus 5 days, median; IQR = 2, 7), respectively (p<0. 001). The ability to describe the trigger event precisely was less in the elderly group (63.8% versus 82.2%, p<0.001). The elderly group significantly underwent brain imaging studies more than the younger group (8.4% versus 3.5%, p = 0.02). Outcome of the treatment after the repositioning procedure was comparable in both groups (p = 0.58). Approximately 80% of patients in both groups had complete recovery from BPPV during their last visit. Dizziness and imbalance were the common presenting symptoms of BPPV in the elderly. The younger patients tended to describe the classic symptom of vertigo that was specific to BPPV more precisely than the elderly. These may contribute to underestimate BPPV, do unnecessary brain imaging study, and take more time to get the correct diagnosis of BPP V among elderly patients.</td>

	<td>In view of patients' recurrent complaints, we were interested in investigating the frequency and headache characteristics in patients during a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) cluster. Patients with BPPV treated at an outpatient dizziness clinic were interviewed about the presence of headache; its quality, localization, severity, time course, and aggravating and alleviating factors; and headache-related disability during their present vertigo cluster. Among 152 patients with BPPV, 53 (34.8%) reported headache associated with vertigo. According to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 8 (15%) patients could be classified as migraine without aura (1.1), 14 (26%) were classified as infrequent episodic tension-type headache associated with pericranial tenderness (2.1.1), 23 (43%) were classified as infrequent episodic tension-type headache without pericranial tenderness (2.1.2), 6 (11%) had cervicogenic headache (11.2.1), and in 2 (4%) patients, the headache could not be specified (14.2). Fifty-two age-matched BPPV patients without headache did not differ in history of headaches, BPPV history, or background diseases. The distribution of canal involvement and number of treatment maneuvers was also similar in both groups. Headache is frequent in BPPV. The most common is tension-type headache, followed by migraine and cervicogenic headache. Head pain seems to be an independently associated epiphenomenon of BPPV that can worsen patients' distress.</td>

	<td>To explore the causes of emergency dizziness stratified to improve the diagnostic efficiency. A total of 1 857 cases of dizziness at our emergency department were collected and their etiologies stratified by age and gender. The top three diagnoses were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV, 31.7%), hypertension (24.0%) and posterior circulation ischemia (PCI, 20.5%). Stratified by age, the main causes of dizziness included BPPV (n = 6), migraine-associated vertigo (n = 2), unknown cause (n = 1) for the group of <18 years; BPPV (51.5%), migraine-associated vertigo (14.5%) and neurosis (7.3%) for 18-44 years; BPPV (36.8%), hypertension (22.4%) and migraine-associated vertigo (11.2%) for 45-59 years; hypertension (30.8%), PCI (29.8%) and BPPV (22.9%) for 60-74 years; PCI (30.7%), hypertension (28.6%) and BPPV (25.5%) for 75-92 years. BPPV, migraine and neurosis were more common in females while hypertension and PCI predominated in males (all P < 0.05). As the main causes of emergency dizziness, BPPV, PCI, hypertension, neurosis and migraine showed the following significant demographic features: BPPV, PCI, hypertension, neurosis and migraine may be the main causes of dizziness. BPPV should be considered initially when vertigo was triggered repeatedly by positional change, especially for young and middle-aged women. And the other common causes of dizziness were migraine-associated vertigo, neurosis and Meniere's disease.Hypertension should be screened firstly in middle-aged and elderly patients presenting mainly with head heaviness and stretching. In elders with dizziness, BPPV is second in constituent ratio to PCI and hypertension.In middle-aged and elderly patients with dizziness, psychological factors should be considered and diagnosis and treatment should be offered timely.</td>

We performed a systematic review without meta-analysis from PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, SciELO and SCOPUS databases, using a combination of keywords "systemic sclerosis AND balance OR vestibular" and "systemic sclerosis AND hearing OR auditory." We included articles published in Portuguese, Spanish, or English until December 2011 and reviews, letters, and editorials were excluded. We found 254 articles, out of which 10 were selected. The study design was described, and the characteristics and frequency of the auditory and vestibular dysfunctions in these individuals were listed. Afterwards, we investigated the hypothesis built by the authors to explain the auditory and vestibular dysfunctions in SS. Hearing loss was the most common finding, with prevalence ranging from 20 to 77%, being bilateral sensorineural the most frequent type. It is hypothesized that the hearing impairment in SS is due to vascular changes in the cochlea. The prevalence of vestibular disorders ranged from 11 to 63%, and the most frequent findings were changes in caloric testing, positional nystagmus, impaired oculocephalic response, changes in clinical tests of sensory interaction, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. High prevalence of auditory and vestibular dysfunctions in patients with SS was observed. Conducting further research can assist in early identification of these abnormalities, provide resources for professionals who work with these patients, and contribute to improving the quality of life of these individuals.</td>

Our aim was to compare the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation (maneuver) vs. conventional therapy (medications) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with BPPV. This was a prospective, single-blinded physician, randomized pilot study comparing two groups of patients who presented to the ED with a diagnosis of BPPV at a Level 1 trauma center with an annual census of approximately 75,000. The first group received standard medications and the second group received a canalith repositioning maneuver. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used to measure symptom resolution. Twenty-six patients were randomized; 11 to the standard treatment arm and 15 to the interventional arm. Mean age ± standard deviation of subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication were 59 ± 12.6 years and 64 ± 11.2 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean ages between the two treatment arms (p = 0.310). Two hours after treatment, the symptoms between the groups showed no difference in measures of nausea (p = 0.548) or dizziness (p = 0.659). Both groups reported a high level of satisfaction, measured on a 0-10 scale. Satisfaction in subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication was 9 ± 1.5 and 9 ± 1.0, respectively; there was no significant difference in satisfaction between the two arms (p = 0.889). Length of stay during the ED visit did not differ between the treatment groups (p = 0.873). None of the patients returned to an ED for similar symptoms. This pilot study shows promise, and would suggest that there is no difference in symptomatic resolution, ED length of stay, or patient satisfaction between standard medical care and canalith repositioning maneuver. Physicians should consider the canalith repositioning maneuver as a treatment option.</td>

Case study and literature review The patient presented to a level 1 trauma and burn center with a ruptured tympanic membrane, otalgia, mixed hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus. After 3 months of observation, the patient's tympanic membrane perforation demonstrated little spontaneous closure. Additionally, he was noted to have formation of a posttraumatic cholesteatoma in the posterior-superior mesotympanum. Over-under tympanoplasty with excision of the cholesteatoma was successful, and the ossicular chain remained intact. The patient underwent vestibular therapy for an ipsilateral uncompensated vestibular weakness. His dizziness resolved, allowing him to return to full employment. The patient's final audiogram demonstrated normal hearing thresholds sloping to a mild mixed hearing loss in the high frequencies, and the tinnitus reduced significantly in intensity but did not resolve. The patient's injury pattern clearly resulted from the damaging effects of the shock wave generated by the lightning bolt, which impacted the patient's thorax. Management of his otologic care was conducted after practices developed for otologic blast injury and resulted in his being able to return to his primary occupation.</td>

	<td>To systematically review the evidence on the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in addition to a canalith repositioning maneuver in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and EMBASE databases. A comprehensive search was performed up to July 2013. Two authors independently scanned the search results to identify randomized controlled trials of vestibular rehabilitation in addition to a canalith repositioning maneuver in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. We included trials that were available in the English language and did not apply publication year or publication status restrictions. Studies were methodologically assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Primary outcome was the effect on vertigo attacks and balance. Of 76 identified trials, only 2 trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review, involving 106 patients. One study was methodologically weak, the other strong. The studies differed in type of intervention, type of outcome, and follow-up time. Both studies reported no significant difference in the vertigo intensity between groups. A small effect was found on balance. Two level II studies in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo showed no effect of vestibular rehabilitation in addition to a canalith repositioning maneuver on vertigo intensity and a small, beneficial effect on balance. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence for an effect of vestibular rehabilitation in addition to a canalith repositioning maneuver in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

Since the typical presentation of labyrinthine fistulas may be sensorineural hearing loss, positional vertigo, or disequilibrium, it is often difficult to distinguish from BPPV or Meniere's disease. Herein we report a 61-year-old female patient with typical symptoms and signs attributable to geotropic type variant of the lateral semicircular canal BPPV on the left side, who eventually was confirmed as having a labyrinthine fistula from chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma on the left side. This is another case where, even in the presence of isolated vertigo showing typical findings of acute peripheral vestibulopathy, other otologic symptoms and signs must not be overlooked. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) generally involves a single semicircular canal (single canal BPPV) but it has been reported that more than one semicircular canal on either the same or the opposite side can be involved in 6.8-20% of the cases (multiple canal BPPV). In this study, the clinical characteristics of multiple canal BPPV were analyzed and compared to those of single canal BPPV. Retrospective analysis was performed on 1054 consecutive patients diagnosed with BPPV. Multiple canal BPPV was diagnosed when the combination of typical nystagmus was provoked by the Dix-Hallpike and supine head roll tests. Canalith repositioning maneuver was performed sequentially starting with the semicircular canal causing more severe nystagmus or symptoms. Clinical characteristics and the treatment course were statistically compared between single canal BPPV and multiple canal BPPV. Among the 1054 patients, single canal BPPV was diagnosed in 1005 patients (95.4%) while multiple canal BPPV was diagnosed in 49 patients (4.6%). BPPV involving semicircular canals on the same side was more common (79.6%) than BPPV with bilateral involvement. The most common combination of the involved canals was ipsilateral posterior and horizontal semicircular canals (63.3%). Multiple canal BPPV was significantly more associated with underlying otologic diseases, especially labyrinthitis. Multiple canal BPPV required more treatment sessions and longer duration of treatment to achieve resolution of nystagmus and symptoms. As all cases of multiple canal BPPV were treated successfully although a longer duration of treatment and more treatment sessions were required compared to single canal BPPV, the results of our study could aid in making an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment of multiple canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>In the present study, about one-third of patients with Meniere's disease developed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)-like attacks. Additionally, more than one-third of all vertigo attacks were BPPV-like attacks. Thus, vertigo attacks in patients with Meniere's disease must be carefully treated because the therapy for such vertigo attacks is totally different from the therapy for BPPV. Physicians sometimes encounter patients with previously diagnosed Meniere's disease who develop BPPV attacks during the course of clinical follow-up. In this study, we explored the frequency with which BPPV was involved in all vertiginous episodes among patients with Meniere's disease. This retrospective study involved 296 patients with Meniere's disease who visited Kyoto University Hospital. The diagnosis of Meniere's disease was based on the guidelines for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease proposed by the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium. We judged the cause of vertigo as one of the following five types: (1) definite Meniere's disease attack, (2) suspicious Meniere's disease attack, (3) definite BPPV attack, (4) suspicious BPPV attack, or (5) unknown. In all, 96 patients (32.8%) developed BPPV-like attacks, and 187 vertiginous episodes (37.9%) were caused by BPPV. The lateral semicircular canal was the most frequently involved canal.</td>

The objective of the study was to evaluate the frequency and outcome of migraine equivalents. This was a retrospective study. We included benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, benign paroxysmal vertigo of infancy, abdominal migraine, cyclic vomiting, aura without migraine, and confusional migraine. We evaluated the frequency of events, treatment, and outcome. Out of 674 children with headache, 38 (5.6%) presented with migraine equivalents. Twenty-one were boys and the mean age was 6.1 years. Fifteen had abdominal migraine, 12 benign paroxysmal vertigo, 5 confusional migraine, 3 aura without migraine, 2 paroxysmal torticollis, and 1 cyclic vomiting. Prophylactic treatment was introduced in 23 patients; 4 lost follow-up and 19 had significant improvement. We conclude that the correct diagnosis of migraine equivalents enables an effective treatment with an excellent outcome. </td>

	<td>The subjective visual vertical (SVV) is an indicator of vestibular otolithic function and mainly processed by the nondominant parietal cortex. We investigated the hypothesis that recovery from SVV tilt after vestibular neuritis can be influenced by the body's lateral preference. This prospective cohort follow-up study included 254 consecutive adult patients with vestibular neuritis. The recovery from SVV tilt was faster in patients with a left hand or eye dominance than in those with a right dominance. While in left-handers the side of the neuritis did not affect the speed of recovery, in right-handed subjects, the recovery from a right-sided neuritis was significantly slower than from a left-sided affection. These observations suggest that subjects with a left sensorimotor dominance have developed more significant midline-crossing projections to the parietal cortex, allowing them to cope faster with a unilateral vestibular deficit.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is generally due to a benign disorder, but it is the most common symptom associated with misdiagnosis of stroke. In this pilot study, we preliminarily assessed the diagnostic performance of a structured bedside algorithm to differentiate central from non-central acute vertigo (AV). Adult patients presenting to a single Emergency Department with vertigo were evaluated with STANDING (SponTAneous Nystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by one of five trained emergency physicians or evaluated ordinarily by the rest of the medical staff (control group). The gold standard was a complete audiologic evaluation by a clinicians who are experts in assessing dizzy patients and neuroimaging. Reliability, sensibility and specificity of STANDING were calculated. Moreover, to evaluate the potential clinical impact of STANDING, neuroimaging and hospitalisation rates were compared with control group. A total of 292 patients were included, and 48 (16.4%) had a diagnosis of central AV. Ninety-eight (33.4%) patients were evaluated with STANDING. The test had good interobserver agreement (k = 0.76), with very high sensitivity (100%, 95%CI 72.3-100%) and specificity (94.3%, 95%CI 90.7-94.3%). Furthermore, hospitalisation and neuroimaging test rates were lower in the STANDING than in the control group (27.6% vs. 50.5% and 31.6% vs. 71.1%, respectively). In conclusion, STANDING seems to be a promising simple structured bedside algorithm that in this preliminary study identified central AV with a very high sensitivity, and was associated with significant reduction of neuroimaging and hospitalisation rates. </td>

	<td>Human otoconia provide mechanical stimuli to deflect hair cells of the vestibular sensory epithelium for purposes of detecting linear acceleration and head tilts. During lifetime, the volume and number of otoconia are gradually reduced. In a process of degeneration morphological changes occur. Structural changes in human otoconia are assumed to cause vertigo and balance disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The aim of this study was to investigate the main principles of morphological changes in human otoconia in dissolution experiments by exposure to hydrochloric acid, EDTA, demineralized water and completely purified water respectively. For comparison reasons artificial (biomimetic) otoconia (calcite gelatin nanocomposits) and natural calcite were used. Morphological changes were detected in time steps by the use of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Under in vitro conditions three main dissolution mechanisms were identified as causing characteristic morphological changes of the specimen under consideration: pH drops in the acidic range, complex formation with calcium ions and changes of ion concentrations in the vicinity of otoconia. Shifts in pH cause a more uniform reduction of otoconia size (isotropic dissolution) whereas complexation reactions and changes of the ionic concentrations within the surrounding medium bring about preferred attacks at specific areas (anisotropic dissolution) of human and artificial otoconia. Owing to successive reduction of material, all the dissolution mechanisms finally produce fragments and remnants of otoconia. It can be assumed that the organic component of otoconia is not significantly attacked under the given conditions. Artificial otoconia serve as a suitable model system mimicking chemical attacks on biogenic specimens. The underlying principles of calcite dissolution under in vitro conditions may play a role in otoconia degeneration processes such as BPPV. </td>

	<td>The architecture of human otoconia has been only poorly understood up to now. Currently, it is assumed that otoconia contain a central core surrounded by a shell. To investigate the inner structure of human otoconia. Human otoconia were investigated by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The diffraction behavior was analyzed using X-ray techniques (XRD). Focused ion beam (FIB) slices of otoconia were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results were correlated with observations on degenerate human otoconia and decalcification experiments using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Artificial otoconia (calcite-gelatine and calcite-gelatine/agarose composites) were investigated in the same way and compared with human otoconia. Human otoconia represent highly mosaic-controlled calcite-based nanocomposites. The inner structure is composed of 3 + 3 branches with an ordered arrangement of nanocomposite particles and parallel orientation of fibrils. The surrounding belly is less ordered and appears more porous. Degenerate otoconia show a successive dissolution of the belly region exposing to the inner structure (branches) in later stages of degeneration. Artificial otoconia reveal identical chemical, crystallographic and morphologic patterns. They are, however, larger in size. Human otoconia show an inner architecture consisting of a less dense belly region and 3 + 3 more dense branches meeting at a central point (center of symmetry). The differences in volume densities and the resulting solubility may play a role in BPPV. Artificial otoconia may serve as a model for further investigations.</td>

	<td>Otoconia are assumed to be involved in inner ear disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Up to now, the distinct structure and morphology of intact and degenerate human utricular otoconia has been only poorly investigated on vital specimen. In this study, human otoconia were obtained from the utricle in five patients undergoing translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. Specimens were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Intact and degenerate otoconia as well as fracture particles of otoconia and bone were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Intact otoconia reveal a uniform size showing characteristic symmetry properties. Degenerative changes can be observed at several stages with gradual minor and major changes in their morphology including fragment formation. EDX analyses reveal the characteristic chemical composition also for otoconia remnants. XRD shows that intact and degenerate otoconia as well as remnants consist of the calcite modification. In conclusion, electron microscopy serves as a standard method for morphological investigations of otoconia. Human utricular otoconia show a uniform outer morphology corresponding to a calcite-based nanocomposite. Morphological changes provide further evidence for degeneration of utricular otoconia in humans, which might be a preconditioning factor causing BPPV. In case of uncertain origin, particles can be clearly assigned to otoconial origin using EDX and XRD analyses.</td>

Patients in group C were received the treatment of Epley maneuver combined with Semont ma- neuver. We recorded the times of treatments in different groups respectively. Statistics of treatment effects and follow-up studies with 3 months after the recovery were assessed. The cure rate of the canalith repositioning on the primary, secondary and tertiary treatment in group A was respective 72% (38/53) and 81% (43/53) and 85% (45/53), in group B was 68% (30/44) and 80% (35/44) and 84% (37/44), in group C was 89% (47/53) and 94% (50/53) and 98% (52/53). The cure rate in group C is significantly higher than group A and group B (χ2 = 6.777, P < 0.05; χ2 = 6.647, P < 0.05). 3 months after recovery 6 patients in group A, 5 patients in group B and 1 patient in group C were relapsed. By the use of Epley maneuver combined with Semont maneuver in the treatment of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo of posterior semicircular canal, the primary cure rate was increased and the numbers of treatments were reduced and the relapse was decreased.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common peripheral vestibular diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of BPPV in vertigo patients and the characteristics of BPPV in diagnosis and repositioning using mechanical assistance maneuvers and to analyze and summarize the reasons showing these characteristics. Seven hundred and twenty-six patients with vertigo were enrolled in this study. All patients were inspected by TRV armchair (SYNAPSYS, model TRV, France). BPPV patients were identified by the examination results. The characteristics and results using TRV armchair in diagnosis and treatment of BPPV were compared and analyzed. Of 726 vertigo patients, 209 BPPV patients were diagnosed, including 58 men and 151 women, aged from 16 to 87 (mean 52.90 ± 11.93) years. There were significant differences in the proportion of BPPV in male and female vertigo patients (P = 0.0233), but no differences among all age groups (P = 0.3201). Of 209 BPPV patients, 208 cases were repositioned by TRV armchair and no one appeared to have otolithic debris relocated into another canal in the repositioning procedures. 202 cases (97.12 %) were successful and six cases (2.87 %) were effective. None of them failed. This study suggests that BPPV is one of the most common diseases in the young vertigo patients, just like that in the old ones. Female of the species has predilection for BPPV and the site of predilection is the right posterior semicircular canals (PC-BPPV). The results of repositioning are perfect using mechanical assistance maneuvers.</td>

All patients in the study had a diagnosis of BPPV confirmed by their history, typical subjective symptom reports, and characteristic positional nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike test and/or roll test. All participants were comprehensively interviewed regarding their medical history, characteristics of the first attack of vertigo, associated symptoms, previous financial costs, and number of hospital visits. The average duration from the appearance of the first symptoms until a final diagnostic positional maneuver was >70 months. On average, patients visited hospitals more than eight times before the final diagnosis due to initial visits to inappropriate departments, including neurology, emergency, orthopaedic surgery, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with a corresponding average financial cost of more than 5,000 RMB. The canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) was effective in 80.65% of patients after the first repositioning maneuver. Our data demonstrated that despite the significant prevalence of BPPV, delays in diagnosis and treatment frequently occur, which have both cost and quality-of-life impacts on both patients and their caregivers. The CRP is very effective for patients with BPPV. It is important for patients to pay more attention to the impact of BPPV on their lives and recognize its nature to ensure compliant follow-up in otolaryngology.</td>

Relevance and risk of bias (RoB) of the selected articles were assessed. Studies with low relevance, high RoB, or both were excluded. For outcomes of interest, absolute risk differences and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted. A total of 373 unique studies were retrieved. Five of these satisfied the eligibility criteria. One study with low RoB and 3 studies with moderate RoB showed that the Epley maneuver is more effective than vestibular rehabilitation at 1-week follow-up with regard to patient-reported symptom relief and conversion of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver from positive to negative (risk differences range from 10% [95% CI, 30-47] to 55% [95% CI, 35-71]). There is inconsistent evidence for the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared with vestibular rehabilitation at 1-month follow-up. Most studies suggest that the Epley maneuver and vestibular rehabilitation are equally effective at 1-month follow-up. The Epley maneuver is more effective in treating p-BPPV than vestibular rehabilitation at 1-week follow-up. There is inconsistent evidence for the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared with vestibular rehabilitation at 1-month follow-up.</td>

	<td>To investigate the clinical significances and formation mechanism by analyzing the characteristics of the reverse phase nystagmus parameters from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) positioning test. There were 183 cases with BPPV, including 108 cases (59.0%) of posterior semicircular canal canalithiasis, 55 cases (30.1%) of horizontal semicircular canal canalithiasis, and 15 cases (8.2%) of horizontal and posterior semicircular canal cupulolithiasis and 5 cases (2.7%) of anterior semicircular canalithiasis . The video-nystagmography was utilized in positioning tests to induce nystagmus. The direction, intensity, time parameters characteristic of vertical nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike test and horizontal nystagmus in roll test were analyzed and compared. There were no reversal phase nystagmus in 15 cases of semicircular canal cupulolithiasis and 5 cases of anterior semicircular canalithiasis. After the disappearance of vertical nystagmus which induced by hanging position (the first phase nystagmus) in 108 cases of posterior semicircular canalithiasis of Dix-Hallpike test, there was 54 cases(50.0%) of posterior semicircular canal canalithiasis displayed downward vertical nystagmus (reverse phase nystagmus) . The latency, duration time and intensity of the first phase nystagmus and reverse phase nystagmus were [(2.00 ± 1.10) s, (3.54 ± 1.42) s], [ (16.27 ± 4.95) s, (61.65 ± 33.69)s] and [ (51.80 ± 25.25) °/s, (10.65 ± 6.29)°/s] respectively; 43 cases(78.2%) of horizontal semicircular canal canalithiasis displayed the opposite to turning head (reverse phase nystagmus) after the horizontal nystagmus, similar with turning head disappeared in Roll test. The latency, duration time and intensity of the first phase of nystagmus and reverse phase nystagmus were [ (1.67 ± 1.07) s, (3.57 ± 1.89)s], [ (25.19 ± 9.74) s, (70.48 ± 40.26)s] and [ (68.47 ± 30.18) °/s, (11.22 ± 8.78)°/s] respectively. Comparing with the latency, duration time, intensity of first phase nystagmus and reverse phase nystagmus of posterior and horizontal semicircular canal canalithiasis, the differences had statistical significances (P < 0.05). Comparing with the first phase nystagmus of reverse phase and no reverse phase nystagmus canalithiasis, the difference of nystagmus intensity had statistical significances (P < 0.05); but the differences of latency and duration of nystagmus had no significant difference (P > 0.05). It is common in PSC-Can and HSC-Can patients that reverse phase nystagmus is one of the clinical features of canalithiasis. It appears in side head position of Rolling test or the hanging of Dix- Hallpike test. More power of the first phase nystagmus has, reverse phase nystagmus will be induced much easier. In comparison of the reverse phase nystagmus, the first phase nystagmus has the shorter incubation and duration, but it has more power. It is helpful to avoid interruptions of clinical statolith positioning and reset since we recognize the reverse phase nystagmus. The mechanism might be similar to the vestibular mirror image nystagmus. It is another form of the vestibular mirror image nystagmus in BPPV patients.</td>

	<td>This study was performed to determine whether a novel treatment was effective against cupulolithiasis associated with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) of the lateral semicircular canal, which is characterized by apogeotropic direction-changing nystagmus. We herein describe our head-tilt hopping (HtH) exercise, which is designed to release otoconial debris strongly adhered to the cupula. The subjects were trained to hop while tilting their heads laterally. They completed 3 to 5 exercise sessions per day over a 4-week period. Each session ended with a 20-hop trial. The HtH exercises were performed by 27 patients with intractable lateral canal BPPV who exhibited positional vertigo and persistent nystagmus beating toward the uppermost ear for more than 4 weeks, despite performing therapeutic head shaking in the horizontal plane maneuver. All the patients were subjected to the supine roll test before and immediately after the first trial as well as after 1 and 4 weeks of the program to evaluate the effect of the treatment on their apogeotropic nystagmus. Nystagmus of 9 (33.3 %) patients disappeared immediately after the first training session. After 1 and 4 weeks of the training, the number of patients that had experienced either of these improvements had increased to 15 (55.6 %) and 19 (70.4 %) subjects, respectively. These results suggest that HtH exercises aimed at releasing otoconial debris from the cupula are feasible as a new therapy for cupulolithiasis associated with intractable lateral canal BPPV. However, further studies for comparison with control are required to confirm these preliminary results.</td>

A total of 190 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo symptoms who had presented between 2009 and 2012 were enrolled for this retrospective case series. Twelve patients with positional up-beating vertical nystagmus, as confirmed by video-nystagmography during the seated-supine positional test, were selected. The incidence and duration of symptoms of multiple canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were significantly lower compared with the other types of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (p = 0.029 and p = 0.048 respectively). Trauma was the leading aetiological factor in those patients (p = 0.012). The average number of therapeutic manoeuvres required for the relief of symptoms in patients with multiple canal involvement was significantly higher than in the other groups (p = 0.041). In patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the presence of vertical up-beating nystagmus while lying down is a unique peripheral sign and could indicate multiple canal involvement. Therefore, the seated-supine positional test should always be included in the test battery.</td>

The aim of this study was to analyze how the site of the diseased canal, type of particulate deposition, duration of symptoms, severity of nystagmus, recurrence, and age affect the VEMP in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). One hundred two patients were enrolled in the study between 2009 and 2012. There were 36 men and 66 women with ages ranging from 16 to 71 years (mean age, 42.28 ± 11.29 years). Patients with BPPV were tested with roll-on and head-hanging maneuvers under video-electronystagmography monitoring and with air conduction cervical VEMP testing. Patients were grouped for duration, severity, recurrence, age, site of canal involvement, and so on, and the results were compared in each subgroup. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for the comparative analysis. Twenty-four patients (23.5%) had a gross VEMP abnormality (absence of VEMP in 6 and greater than 25% depression of the amplitude in 18). Abnormality of VEMPs was not correlated with factors including age, severity of nystagmus, number of maneuvers applied, and the site of canal involvement (P < .05). However, persistence or recurrence of symptoms has an effect on VEMP results (P = .016). Vestibular evoked myogenic potential is a useful tool to study the otolithic function in patients with BPPV and should be included in the test battery.</td>

Incidence rate of serious complications was 0% in the modified Epley-alone group and 1.3% in the self-treatment group (P > 0.05). Complementary self-treatment with modified Epley maneuver treated PC-BPPV sooner and more effectively, Compared with modified Epley maneuver alone. And its incidence rate of serious complications didn't increase. Chair-assisted repositioning showed better result than hand repositioning alone, and self-treatment at home can reduce the effect of the gap.

We conducted a systematic review to examine the association between osteoporosis and BPPV. Four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the China Network Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to identify all papers, published in either English or Chinese, examining the association between osteoporosis (osteopenia) and BPPV. Seven studies were eligible for analysis, though these studies included some weaknesses. Most of the studies demonstrated a correlation between osteoporosis (osteopenia) and the occurrence and recurrence of BPPV, especially in older women. Patients with osteoporosis may require more canalith-repositioning procedures. This systematic review provides insight into currently available evidence and elucidates the possible existence of an association between BPPV and osteoporosis (osteopenia). However, the evidence supporting that conclusion is not strong, and further studies are needed to clarify the association between these conditions.</td>

Totally 490 patients with vertigo and nystagmus provoked by Dix-Hallpike maneuver were included in the present analysis. Among all the patients, 55 (11.2%) of them presented with bilateral nystagmus by the provocative test. According to the type of nystagmus provoked by Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the 55 patients can be divided into the following four categories. (1) Bilateral geotropic (n = 16) and apogeotropic nystagmus (n = 5): all these patients were diagnosed with horizontal canal BPPV and free of vertigo after head side-shaking exercise in supine position and Barbecue maneuver. (2) Bilateral predominant down-beating nystagmus (n = 2): patients in this group were diagnosed with anterior canal BPPV, and got recovered after Kim maneuver. (3) Bilateral torsional up-beating geotropic nystagmus (n = 20): after a lying-down test, 6 of the patients manifested as vertical up-beating nystagmus and 14 patients remained torsional up-beating nystagmus. The former were diagnosed with bilateral posterior canal BPPV, and were cured after bilateral PRM therapy, and the latter were diagnosed with horizontal canal BPPV, who were cured after Barbecue maneuver. (4) Torsional up-beating geotropic nystagmus on one side and down-beating nystagmus on the other side (n = 12). The down-beating nystagmus on the other side disappeared when the patients was firstly seated up with head down in 30 degrees for half an hour before second Dix-Hallpike maneuver. These patients were diagnosed with unilateral posterior canal BPPV and cured by PRM therapy. It is common for vertigo patients with bilateral nystagmus induced by Dix-Hallpike test. The diagnoses should be made by the types of nystagmus provoked step by step before maneuver therapy.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of dizziness. The underlying pathomechanism responsible for the recurrent vertigo attacks has been elucidated in detail and highly effective treatment strategies (liberation maneuvers) have been developed. However, many BPPV patients complain about problems of balance especially following liberation maneuvers. To objectively demonstrate differences in balance performance in BPPV patients compared to healthy subjects both prior and after BPPV liberation maneuvers. Seven patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal and nine healthy subjects participated. To assess balance while standing, we analyzed the location and temporal stability of the center of pressure recorded by pressure-sensitive electronic soles during Romberg testing (on stable ground and on foam) and tandem stand. To assess regularity of gait, we analyzed the step frequency during walking of 50 m. All tests were performed prior and after liberation maneuvers in both groups. Healthy subjects and patients differ significantly in their balance performance and use different stabilization strategies both prior and after liberation maneuvers. Both Romberg tests indicated poorer balance in BPPV patients (mean COP shifted towards toes), especially in posttreatment tests, while tandem stand appeared unaltered. We did not observe differences in escorted (by an experimenter) walking regularities between patients and healthy subjects and between pre- and post-maneuver testing. Our findings confirm the typical clinical observation of a further posttreatment deterioration of already impaired postural performance in BPPV patients. While the etiology and the time course of this peculiar problem warrants further studies, the treating physician should be familiar with this transient side effect of therapeutic maneuvers to provide adequate counseling of patients. Finally, we successully demonstrated the pressure-sensitive electronic soles as a new and potentially useful tool for both clinical and research purposes.</td>

	<td>Research to identify whether dizziness is a geriatric syndrome has largely overlooked often treatable vestibular causes. To ascertain the degree to which vestibular and other causes of dizziness interact in older people, an eight-month retrospective case-note review was undertaken in patients aged ≥: 65 years referred with dizziness or imbalance to an audiovestibular medicine clinic. Of 41 patients aged 65-93 years old, 15 (37%) had multiple symptom triggers, 23 (56%) had recent dizziness-related falls, 24 (59%) and 10 (24%) had peripheral and central vestibular causes for dizziness respectively, whereas 6 (15%) had both. Sixteen (39%) had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, of which 13 (32%) had an additional peripheral vestibular impairment. Twenty-six (63%) had other (general medical/cardiac) causes; of these 13 (50%) also had vestibular causes. Polypharmacy, orthostatic hypotension, psychotropic drug use and anxiety were common contributory factors. Vestibular causes of dizziness contribute to a multifactorial geriatric syndrome. All patients with dizziness and falls should have a vestibular assessment (especially peripheral) to improve quality of life and reduce falls. </td>

	<td>In contrast to the posterior- and horizontal-canal variants, data on the frequency and therapeutic management of anterior-canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (AC-BPPV) are sparse. To synthesize the existing body of evidence into a systematic review regarding the incidence and treatment of AC-BPPV. Systematic search of medical databases employing predefined criteria, using the term "anterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo." The electronic search retrieved 178 unique citations, 31 of which were considered eligible for further analysis. Analysis of the collected data revealed an estimated occurrence of AC-BPPV among benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients of 3% (range 1-17.1%). No controlled therapeutic trials could be identified, and so the analysis was focused on uncontrolled case series. Treatment was categorized into three groups: Epley maneuver, Yacovino maneuver, and specific, nonstandard maneuvers described in individual articles. All three categories demonstrated success rates of over 75%, and the overall sample-size-weighted mean was 85.6%. The present analysis demonstrated that AC-BPPV comprises about 3% of all BPPV cases. It can be treated safely using the Epley, Yacovino, and other maneuvers with rates of symptom resolution lying in the range of that reported for the other, more frequent canal variants. Multicenter controlled trials are needed in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of AC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>To determine the rate of symptom resolution in patients with posttraumatic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and to determine if it differs from resolution rates in patients with BPPV and without a history of head trauma. Systematic review of the literature was performed using Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. English and French articles meeting inclusion criteria and published between 1946 and October 2014 were included. Data were independently extracted from the articles by 2 reviewers using data collection forms developed a priori. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were decided a priori. Studies were included if they reported on at least 1 case of posttraumatic BPPV (t-BPPV), reported on outcomes of all patients with t-BPPV, had a clearly defined inception point, and provided a clear diagnosis of BPPV (defined a priori by reviewers). A total of 3017 titles, 362 abstracts, and 67 articles were reviewed, from which 16 articles met inclusion criteria and underwent data extraction. There were a total of 207 patients with posttraumatic BPPV identified. Among the 207 patients, 151 (73%) had resolution of symptoms. The T-BPPV patients may have more multi-canal involvement and may require more repositioning maneuvers for resolution compared to patients with nontraumatic BPPV. Available evidence does not support the notion that symptom resolution rates in patients with posttraumatic BPPV are worse than those with nontraumatic BPPV. However, well-designed studies with adequate cohorts are lacking. Additional well-executed studies are needed to confirm this lack of difference in resolution rates.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common disorder of the vestibular system of the inner ear, which is a vital part of maintaining balance. Although the efficacy of the Epley maneuver-also known as the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM)-is well established, data comparing CRM versus a hybrid treatment are lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a hybrid treatment, the Gans repositioning maneuver (GRM) either with or without postmaneuver restrictions, compared with CRM on treatment of posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV). Study design was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 45 patients (30 males and 15 females) with unilateral PC-BPPV were randomly allocated to one of three equal groups on the basis of the date of the first visit with matched assignment for gender: a GRMR group (GRM with postmaneuver restrictions), a GRM group, and a CRM group. Patients received weekly administration of the maneuver until resolution of symptoms. The Dix-Hallpike test was performed before treatment at every appointment, and finally after 1 mo from the last maneuver. Nystagmus duration and vertigo intensity were recorded. The supine roll test was performed in case the Dix-Hallpike test was negative to test otoconial migration. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance, paired t-tests with a Bonferroni correction, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. All patients showed improvement within the groups, and PC-BPPV symptoms were resolved by an average of 2, 1.7, and 1.6 maneuvers for GRMR, GRM, and CRM, respectively, with no statistical differences among the three groups (p > 0.05). Only two patients had recurrence, and one patient had horizontal BPPV at 1 mo follow-up. We demonstrated that the GRM as a new treatment is effective in treating PC-BPPV with no benefits to postmaneuver restrictions.</td>

We studied all patients with idiopathic BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal who were treated during 3 consecutive years, divided into 2 groups: those with recent disease onset (within 4 weeks) and those with more remote disease onset. Outcome of treatment by repositioning maneuver and rate of recurrence were compared. 110 patients had BPPV of recent onset and 121 of more remote onset (mean ages 51.3 and 58.2, respectively). Treatment outcomes were similar in both groups, but the rate of recurrence was higher in patients with BPPV of longer duration (21.5% versus 10%). Long duration of the disease does not affect the treatment outcome in patients with idiopathic BPPV, but is correlated with increased rate of recurrence. Older age of these patients is probably a contributing factor for recurrence.</td>

	<td>Detection of peripheral vestibular loss (PVL) in children with dizziness is an important and challenging task. The static subjective visual vertical (SVV) test can effectively detect PVL, but requires specialized equipment. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of a smartphone-based SVV test at detecting PVL in pediatric patients. Thirty-nine patients between 7 and 18 years old (mean=14.0±2.70) underwent conventional SVV (conv-SVV) and smartphone-based SVV (ip-SVV) testing. Subjects included 6 with PVL (based on clinical history and other vestibular tests), 6 with benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV), 11 with central causes of vertigo (CV), 8 with non-vestibular dizziness (NVD), and 8 controls. Mean ip-SVV score in the PVL group (2.77±1.45) was significantly higher than in each of the other groups (BPPV=0.89±0.55; CV=1.08±0.68; NVD=1.45±1.19; Control=1.08±0.73; one-way analysis of variance, p=0.008), and remained significant after adjusting for age and gender by multiple linear regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis predicted an optimal ip-SVV cut-off score of >2.13° with a sensitivity of 66.7%, specificity of 97.0%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 80%, and negative predictive value of 94.1% for detecting PVL. Sensitivity and PPV improved to 75% and 100%, respectively, when subjects tested >1 month after symptom onset (n=24) were excluded. Smartphone-based SVV testing is a simple and useful office-based method for detecting PVL in children with dizziness.</td>

Two male patients (65 and 58 years old) described rotational vertigo after violent and brief (1- to 2-second) oscillations of the head (head jolting) that triggered intense horizontal nystagmus lasting 45 seconds. Accelerations of the head required to induce these episodes could only be achieved by the patients themselves. In case 1, the episodes gradually disappeared over a 6-year period. In case 2, magnetic resonance imaging (3-T) suggested a filling defect within the left horizontal semicircular canal. He underwent surgical canal plugging in March 2013 that resolved the symptoms. We attribute head-jolting nystagmus to dislodged material within the horizontal semicircular canal and provide a mechanistic model to explain its origin.</td>

A 74-years-old patient was admitted to emergency department with dizziness and nausea. The neurologic examination showed a spontaneous nystagmus, whereas otologic examination revealed a left tympanic membrane perforation with mild discharge. A temporal bone computed tomography imaging was scheduled to exclude cholesteatoma and perilymphatic fistula. Computed tomography detected an anterior sigmoid sinus with middle fossa defect and subcutaneous course of the sinus in posterior-superior portion of the external ear canal skin with no cholesteatoma sign. Thus, Dix-Hallpike was performed on the patient and was positive on the right side. The patient was diagnosed as benign positional vertigo. Sigmoid sinus is an important landmark in otologic surgeries and in some patients it may be problematic because of its dehiscence. To avoid any surgical complications it is highly important to evaluate a temporal bone computed tomography imaging before any transmastoid, retroauricular and edoaural surgeries.</td>

	<td>Dizziness and imbalance are clinically poorly defined terms, which affect &nbsp;30% of people over 65 years of age. In these people, it is often difficult to define the primary cause of dizziness, as it can stem from cardiovascular, vestibular, psychological, and neuromuscular causes. However, identification of the primary cause is vital in determining the most effective treatment strategy for a patient. Our aim is to accurately identify the prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), peripheral, and central vestibular hypofunction in people aged over 50 years who had experienced dizziness within the past year. Seventy-six participants aged 51-92 (mean ± SD = 69 ± 9.5 years) were tested using the head thrust dynamic visual acuity (htDVA) test, dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), as well as sinusoidal and unidirectional rotational chair testing, in order to obtain data for htDVA score, DHI score, sinusoidal (whole-body, 0.1-2 Hz with peak velocity at 30°/s) vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and phase, transient (whole-body, acceleration at 150°/s(2) to a constant velocity rotation of 50°/s) VOR gain and time constant (TC), optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) gain, and TC (whole-body, constant velocity rotation at 50°/s). We found that BPPV, peripheral and central vestibular hypofunction were present in 38 and 1% of participants, respectively, suggesting a likely vestibular cause of dizziness in these people. Of those with a likely vestibular cause, 63% had BPPV; a figure higher than previously reported in dizziness clinics of &nbsp;25%. Our results indicate that htDVA, sinusoidal (particularly 0.5-1 Hz), and transient VOR testing were the most effective at detecting people with BPPV or vestibular hypofunction, whereas DHI and OKN were effective at only detecting non-BPPV vestibular hypofunction. </td>

Objective of our study was to present a simple method to assess S.V.V. and to analyze S.V.V. changes in various vestibular disorders. 100 subjects presenting with vestibular disorders in period of 1 year 2 months were subjected to Neurotological history and examination. Patients with non-vestibular causes were excluded. S.V.V was tested with a simple innovative device-a specially designed bucket. The angle of deviation from vertical was noted in degrees. Normal deviation is 0 ± 2°. Out of 23 patients with vestibular neuritis 83 % showed abnormal S.V.V. Amongst 11 patients of Meniere's disease, 55 % and 42 patients of BPPV, 71 % had abnormal S.V.V. Amongst 24 patients with other causes 15 % showed abnormal S.V.V. S.V.V is a reliable screening tool in assessment of vestibular dysfunction along with other clinical tests. It has a prognostic value during recovery following vestibular damage. The modified 'Bucket' is a simple, easy to use and cost-effective device to do the S.V.V. in daily practice. </td>

	<td>There is evidence suggesting that migraine may be associated with vertigo. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common form of vertigo, in patients with migraine using a population-based dataset. The National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan was searched for migraine patients and was also used to select an age- and sex-matched cohort of subjects without migraine. The analyses included 8266 migraine patients and 8266 controls. The incidence rates of BPPV in the two cohorts were compared. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify risk factors for BPPV in migraine patients. In the migraine cohort, 1.11% of the patients developed BPPV compared to 0.5% of the controls. The incidence rate ratio was 2.03 (95% CI 1.41-2.97; p <0.001). Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that age ≥40 years (HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.40-3.45; p = 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR 4.62; 95% CI 1.12-19.01; p = 0.034), and the number of outpatient department visits to neurologists because of migraine (HR 2.93; 95% CI 2.50-3.44; p >0.001) were associated with an increased risk for BPPV. The results showed that patients with migraine had a 2.03-fold increased risk of developing BPPV compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Although BPPV may not be a common condition in migraine patients, migraine sufferers with vestibular symptoms should alert physicians to the possibility of BPPV, particularly if patients are aged ≥40 years, have a history of coronary artery disease, or have frequent visits to neurologists clinics because of migraine.</td>

	<td>To analyze and summarize nystagmus of patients with posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in positioning test,and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of posterior canal BPPV (PSC-BPPV). The present study was conducted on 175 patients who had unilateral BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). Their positional nystagmus recorded by videnonystagmography in Dix-Hallpike test,roll test and roll over test were analyzed to summarize the characteristics of nystagmus on nystagmograph of PSC-BP-PV. Of the 175 patients, lesion was located in the left PSC in 69 (39.4%) patients,the right PSC in 106 (60. 6%)patients. The nystagmus of patients with PSC-canalithiasis showed upward on the vertical phase of nystagmograph and orientated the different side on horizontal phase in the head hangging position. The horizontal phase pointed to the contralateral side in 47(26. 9%) patients, the ipsilateral contralateral side in 100(57. 1%) patients,no significant reverse ingredients in 28(16.0%) patients. When these patients returned to sit,139(79.4%) patients showed down beating positioning nystagmus, whereas 36 (20. 6%) patients with no nystagmus only had a short vertigo or dizziness. The horizontal phase of the 139 patients pointed to the contralateral side in 40(22. 9%) patients,the ipsilateral contralateral side in 68(38. 9%) patients,no significant reverse ingredients in 31(17. 7%) patients. In roll test,12 patients of the right PSC-BPPV presented an up-beating rotatory nystagmus when the head turned to right,and 5 patients of the left PSC-BPPV presented a down-beating rotatory nystagmus when the head turned to left. When the patients changed body from the left lateral position to the right lateral position in the roll over test, 74(42. 3%) patientsshowed vertical positioning nystagmus. In 30 patients who presented an up-beating nystagmus, there were 25(83. 3%) patientscame from the right PSC-BPPV. In 44 patients who presented a down-beating nystagmus, there were 36(81. 8%) patientscame from the left PSC-BPPV. The direction of the vertical nystagmus was highly correlated with the judgment about the side of the PSC-BPPV in roll over test (P<0. 01). The patient with PSC-canalithiasis showed an uncertain direction in torsional nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike test,the diagnosis was mainly concern with the vertical nystagmus. When we found a rotatory nystagmus with much more up-beating nystagmus in roll test, it might be PSC-BPPV. We also can use the roll over test to diagnose the location of the otolith in which side of the PSC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>This prospective study was designed to evaluate the differences between immediate and delayed canal re-entry of otoliths after therapeutic manoeuvres in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A total of 196 patients with BPPV were visited and 127 matched our inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.74 years. The horizontal semicircular canal (HSC) was involved in 30 cases and the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) in 97 patients. Patients with hearing loss in the ear affected by BPPV have a more recurrent form, compared to those with normal hearing. An immediate canal re-entry was recorded in 3 patients with HSC BPPV, all with geotropic nystagmus. In 7 patients with PSC BPPV, the immediate canal re-entry was detected and the delayed form was noted in 5 patients. The patients with the delayed canal re-entry underwent more than 2 previous manoeuvres. The canal re-entry was not related to the manoeuvre performed. The timing of the Dix-Hallpike test to verify the resolution of the BPPV had a significant role in immediate canal re-entry. A recurrence in the follow-up at least one month after treatment was recorded in 20 patients and was more frequent in patients that had canal re-entry. The canal re-entry or canal switch is a clinical entity that should be kept in mind of the neurotologist when approaching BPPV patients. It is important to distinguish it from recurrence when delayed and from manoeuvre failure when immediate. The timing of manoeuvre performing, in particular the final verification test after therapeutic sessions, is important to prevent the immediate reflux of particles into canals. </td>

	<td>There are currently different groups of drugs for the pharmacotherapy of vertigo, nystagmus and cerebellar disorders: antiemetics; anti-inflammatories, antimenieres, and antimigraineous medications and antidepressants, anticonvulsants, aminopyridines as well as acetyl-DL-leucine. In acute unilateral vestibulopathy, corticosteroids improve the recovery of peripheral vestibular function, but currently there is not sufficient evidence for a general recommendation. There is insufficient evidence to support the view that 16 mg t. i. d. or 48 mg t. i. d. betahistine has an effect in Menière's disease. Therefore, higher dosages are recommended. In animal studies, it was shown that betahistine increases cochlear blood flow. In vestibular paroxysmia, oxcarbazepine was effective (one randomized controlled trial (RCT)). Aminopyridines are recommended for the treatment of downbeat nystagmus (two RCTs) and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2, one RCT). There has been no RCT on the efficacy of beta-blockers or topiramate but one RCT on flunarizine in vestibular migraine. Based on clinical experience, a treatment analogous to that for migraine without aura can be recommended. Acetyl-DL-leucine improved cerebellar ataxia (two observational studies); it also accelerated central compensation in an animal model of acute unilateral lesion, but RCTs were negative. There are ongoing RCTs on treatment of vestibular paroxysmia with carbamazepine (VESPA), acute unilateral vestibulopathy with betahistine (BETAVEST), vestibular migraine with metoprolol (PROVEMIG), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with vitamin D (VitD@BPPV), EA2 with 4-aminopyridine versus acetazolamide (EAT-2-TREAT), and cerebellar ataxias with acetyl-DL-leucine (ALCAT).</td>

	<td>The prevalence of vertigo and dizziness in people aged more than 60 years reaches 30%, and due to aging of world population, the number of patients is rapidly increasing. The presence of dizziness in the elderly is a strong predictor of falls, which is the leading cause of accidental death in people older than 65 years. Balance disorders in the elderly constitute a major public health problem, and require an adequate diagnosis and management by trained physicians. In the elderly, common causes of vertigo may manifest differently, as patients tend to report less rotatory vertigo and more non-specific dizziness and instability than younger patients, making diagnosis more complex. In this mini review, age-related degenerative processes that affect balance are presented. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches oriented to the specific impaired system, including visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular pathways, are proposed. In addition, presbystasis - the loss of vestibular and balance functions associated with aging - benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and stroke (in acute syndromes) should always be considered. </td>

The episodes of spinning often last 10 to 20 seconds, but may occasionally last as long as 1 minute. There are several forms of BPPV. In nearly all cases, highly effective treatment can be offered to patients. This article reviews the current state of our understanding of this condition and its management.</td>

	<td>Vestibular migraine is now considered a distinct diagnostic entity by both the Barany Society and the International Headache Society. The recognition of vestibular migraine as a diagnostic entity required decades and was presaged by several reports indicating that a large proportion of patients with migraine headaches have vestibular symptoms and that a large proportion of patients with undiagnosed episodic vestibular symptoms have migraine headache. Despite the availability of diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine, challenges to diagnosis include variability in terms of the character of dizziness, the presence or absence of clearly defined attacks, the duration of attacks, and the temporal association between headache or other migrainous features and vestibular symptoms. Also, symptoms of vestibular migraine often overlap with symptoms of other causes of dizziness, especially Ménière's disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This article will discuss the demographics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, physical examination findings, laboratory testing, comorbidities, treatment options, and pathophysiology of vestibular migraine. Future research in the field of vestibular migraine should include both clinical and basic science efforts to better understand the pathophysiology of this condition. Controlled treatment trials for vestibular migraine are desperately needed. </td>

	<td>To analyze the clinical characteristics, prognosis and therapeutic effects of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) patients associated with vertigo, and to investigate the strategy of diagnosis and treatment. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 240 patients diagnosed as SSHL with vertigo, who were treated in the Chinese PLA General Hospital from July 2008 to August 2012. Various factors affecting the therapeutic effects were analyzed, such as audiological features, vestibular function tests, genders, audiograms, lasting before seeing a doctor, courses of vertigo and vascular factors. Among the contemporaneous SSHL patients (873 cases), the cases with vertigo accounted for 27.49% (240/873). Among the 240 patients with vertigo, the cases with different hearing impaired degree of mild, moderate, severe and profound were 30, 13, 28 and 34, respectively, primarily by the profound cases. Detailed vestibular function tests were performed in 97 patients, with 54 cases having unilateral vestibular disfunction and 43 patients having normal vestibular function, among which 23 cases were diagnosed as benign paroxymal positional vertigo (BBPV). The relationship between vestibular function and different hearing impaired degrees or various audiogram types had no statistically significant difference. 219 cases had detailed records of the onset time of cochlear and vestibular symptoms, including 122 patients with cochlear symptoms and dizziness occurring simultaneously. After standardized drug treatment, the total effective rate was 46.67%, with recovery in 17 cases, excellent in 34 cases, better in 61 cases and poor in 128 cases, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that different genders, audiogram types, vertigo courses of time, the results of vestibular function and neck vascular ultrasounds were not related to the curative effects, while, the treatment time after onset was significantly associated with treatment effects. SSHL with vertigo has a high incidence, primarily single side affected, with relatively severe hearing impairment, and total deafness and downslope hearing curve mainly. Vestibular function can be normal or low in SSHL patients with vertigo, with a higher incidence of BPPV. Vestibular and cochlear symptoms occur simultaneously in more than half of the patients. The detection rate of vestibular dysfunction gradually increased, as the degree of hearing loss increased, without statistical significance although. The therapeutic effects of sudden hearing loss with vertigo cases have no relationship with dizziness duration or vestibular function, while the disease course plays an important role in treatment.</td>

This is associated with risk of falling and is compounded in elderly persons with other neurologic deficits and chronic medical problems. BPPV is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. BPPV is a common vestibular disorder leading to significant morbidity, psychosocial impact, and medical costs. The objective of Epley's maneuver, which is noninvasive, inexpensive, and easily administered, is to move the canaliths out of the canal to the utricle where they no longer affect the canal dynamics. Our study aims to analyze the response to Epley's maneuver in a series of patients with posterior canal BPPV and compares the results with those treated exclusively by medical management alone. Even though many studies have been conducted to prove the efficacy of this maneuver, this study reinforces the validity of Epley's maneuver by comparison with the medical management. </td>

	<td>Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most frequent vestibular disorders. BPPV as a complication of Osteotome Sinus Floor Elevation (OSFE) is a complication that rarely occurs. The aim of this paper is to better understand the mechanisms underlying the BPPV after SFE with the osteotomes. This could be important for all the dental and maxillofacial surgeons that should know and manage this clinical occurrence. The osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE), firstly described by Summers requires the use of a surgical mallet for striking the bone, until the optimal depth is reached. The surgical mallet develops a mechanical trauma, even if the striking is performed with a gentle percussion. The recent literature describes an average occurrence of OSFE-induced BPPV quite low, but the symptoms show to be unpleasant and severe, often able to alter the patient's daily life. A successful remission of BPPV following treatment with a particle repositioning maneuver will be necessary and relatively urgent for the surgeons who have experienced this clinical complication. The surgeons, therefore, must be aware of these complications and about the ways to manage them.</td>

	<td>Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) is characterized by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position, most commonly extension and rotation of the neck while supine. It has been clinically observed that there is a subgroup of patients in whom the BPPV disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. However, little is known about the familial/genetic factors that may contribute to a predisposition to develop the disease. We ascertained and performed a genome-wide scan on a three-generation family in which multiple family members developed BPPV. We performed whole genome mapping with 400 microsatellite repeat markers and analyzed this trait using both autosomal dominant and recessive models of inheritance. Two point linkage analysis showed LOD scores of one or greater than one on chromosomes 7, 15, 16 and 20. Independent of the model of inheritance, the highest two-point LOD scores localized to same marker on chromosome 15. Multipoint linkage analysis showed the highest LOD score of 2.84 to markers on chromosome 15 with the autosomal dominant model. Haplotype reconstruction indicates that the BPPV gene in this family maps to a critical chromosomal 15 interval between markers GATA151F03N and GATA85D02. Discovery of a BPPV gene (or genes) will facilitate a better understanding of not only BPPV, but also the vestibular system. In addition, with improved understanding of the pathophysiology the potential development of alternative therapies for BPPV may be possible.</td>

By analyzing the clinical data of 271 ISSHL patients, they were divided into without vertigo group (n = 169) and vertigo group (n = 102). In vertigo group, 34 cases were patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) secondary to the ISSHL. All patients received conventional treatment. According to the types of BPPV, patients with secondary BPPV received Epley maneuver or Barbecue roll maneuver. By analyzing the results of the pure tone audiometry test and treatment outcomes of the patients, we summarized the clinical characteristics of ISSHL patients with vertigo. The audiometric curves of ISSHL with vertigo group were mainly at high frequency. The degrees of hearing loss of these patients were severe and profound. After treatment, the improvement of hearing threshold for ISSHL with vertigo group was lower than that for ISSHL without vertigo group. What's more, the rate of recovery, success and total effective of audition for ISSHL with vertigo group was also obviously lower than that for ISSHL without vertigo group. Of all the patients with BPPV, 27 cases of posterior semicircular canal and 7 cases of lateral semicircular canal were identified. All patients with BPPV were diagnosed as the same ears as the ISSHL. ISSHL with vertigo group lost hearing more severely than ISSHL without vertigo group. Also, the improvement of hearing and the effective after treatment were really poor. The symptoms of ISSHL with BPPV group improved and eased significantly than that of ISSHL without BPPV group. The major of BPPV secondary to the ISSHL occurs in the posterior semicircular canal. The canalith repositioning is an effective therapy to the secondary BPPV.</td>

The clinical data of 38 patients affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who were induced vertigo in the straight head-hanging test from July 2009 to July 2014 in the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Navy General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. After diagnosis, the patients were underwent quick repositioning maneuver along the sagittal plane. Of the 38 cases studied, 15 patients (39.5%) were males and 23 patients (60.5%) were females. The age of the patients ranged from 33 to 71 years with a mean of 55 ± 12 years. The median duration between symptoms and diagnosis was 8 days. The total improvement was 33 cases (86.8%) in patients with superior semicircular canal BPPV when they were re-evaluated at 1 week and 32 cases (84.2%) at 3 months time. Quick repositioning maneuver along the sagittal plane is an effective, easy alternative for treatment of the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo induced vertigo in the straight head-hanging test. It is not necessary to identify the directions of the nystagmus.</td>

	<td>To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group. BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.</td>

The Dix-Hallpike maneuver was applied to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV. Patients with BPPV were administered the Epley maneuver every week for one month and followed-up for treatment response assessment. Motocross and control groups were similar in terms of demographic and laboratory parameters. While BPPV was detected in four motocross racers (10%) according to Dix-Hallpike maneuver outcome and clinical findings, there was no BPPV in the control group. Of the motocross racers with BPPV, three had unilateral, one had bilateral disease. Of these patients, Epley maneuver was applied two times in two patients and three times in the other two patients. There was no vertigo or nystagmus in any of the patients with BPPV in one month. Intensive motocross activity is a cause of post-traumatic BPPV developing without head trauma. Large-scale, randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the post-traumatic etiology of BPPV in motocross racers.</td>

	<td>A correct diagnosis and a proper treatment may yield a rapid and simple cure for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Although the Gufoni maneuver is widely used to treat apogeotropic horizontal-canal BPPV (HC-BPPV), few studies have clarified the relationship between the speed and intensity of maneuver execution and successful canalith reposition. To evaluate the effect of accelerated execution of the Gufoni maneuver, a prospective randomized controlled study was conducted with HC-BPPV patients in a single dizziness clinic. The patients had been diagnosed with apogeotropic HC-BPPV and were undergoing treatment at the dizziness clinic of a tertiary university hospital from January 2013 to August 2014. Two groups were treated with the maneuver performed at different speeds and the resolution rate was compared. The accelerated maneuver group was subjected to faster position changing-within 1s-during the reposition maneuver, while the non-accelerated maneuver group underwent slower maneuvers. Therapeutic efficacy was defined as dizziness relief or resolution of nystagmus within 1h. Fifty patients with apogeotropic HC-BPPV were enrolled and treated with the Gufoni maneuver in two groups of 25 patients. The overall resolution rate was 48% (24 of 50; p=1.00), regardless of acceleration. Our results suggest that a faster, more intense execution of the Gufoni maneuver provides little benefit in treating apogeotropic HC-BPPV. Detachment of the otolith from the cupula or the gravitational force-when the otolith is in the anterior arm of the HC-may be more important contributors to treatment efficacy. </td>

	<td>Background and aim Chronic musculoskeletal pain, e.g. whiplash associated disorders (WAD), fibromyalgia and myalgia, causes significant burden on both the individual and on society as a whole. In a previous study, the authors concluded that there is a likely connection between chronic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)/canalithiasis and headache, neck pain, generalized pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunctions as well as tinnitus. The balance dysfunction in BPPV/canalithiasis is dynamic and not static. This leads to a perpetual postural mismatch. The vicious cycle of a disturbed equilibrium control system may be the driving force behind the vicious cycle of pain. The aim of this study is to investigate if otolith-repositioning manoeuvres in patients with chronic BPPV/canalithiasis can be beneficial. Methods During a period of about two years a prospective observational study on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain referred for physiotherapy was performed. Those with a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) inquiry score above 20 underwent further investigations to diagnose chronic BPPV/canalithiasis. Diagnostic criteria: (A) The diagnosis of BPPV/canalithiasis was confirmed with the following: (1) specific history of vertigo or dizziness provoked by acceleration/deceleration, AND (2) nystagmus and symptoms during at least one of the test positions; (B) the disorder had persisted for at least one year. Specific otolith repositioning manoeuvre for each semi-circular canal (SCC) was performed. Symptom questionnaire ("yes" or "no" answers during a personal interview) and a follow-up questionnaire were used. Results The responders of the follow-up questionnaire constituted the study group. Thirty-nine patients responded (i.e. 87%) (31 females, 8 males) with a median age of 44 years (17-65). The median duration of the disease was5 years. Seventy-nine percent had ahistory ofhead or neck trauma. The DHI median score was 48 points (score >60 indicates a risk of fall). The video-oculography confirmed BPPV/canalithiasis in more than one semi-circular canal in all patients. In the present study the frequency of affected anterior semi-circular canal (SSC) was at a minimum of 26% and could be as high as 65%. Ninety-five percent suffered from headache, 92% from neck pain, 54% had generalized pain, and 56% had temporo-mandibular joint region pain. Fatigue (97%), aggravation by physical exertion (87%), decreased ability to concentrate (85%) aswellas visual disturbances (85%) were the most frequently reported symptoms, and 49% suffered from tinnitus. The median number of otolith repositioning manoeuvres done was six (2-29). Median time span between finishing otolith repositioning manoeuvres and answering the questionnaire was 7 months. Effects of treatment and conclusion The present study has shown that repositioning of otoliths in the SCCs in nearly all patients with chronic BPPV/canalithiasis ameliorated pain and other symptoms. The correlation between vertigo/dizziness and the majority of symptoms was significant. Therefore, there is strong evidence to suggest that there is a connection between chronic BPPV/canalithiasis and chronic pain as well as the above-mentioned symptoms. Implications Patients with unexplained pain conditions should be evaluated withthe Dizziness Handicap Inventory-questionnaire, which can identify treatable balance disorders.</td>

	<td>To clarify the pathophysiological basis of persistent geotropic positional nystagmus (PGN) in patients with the horizontal canal type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (H-BPPV), the time constant (TC) of nystagmus and the relationship between its slow phase eye velocity (SPV) and the angle of head rotation in supine were defined. Geotropic or apogeotropic positional nystagmus was recorded by video-oculography and analysed three-dimensionally. Geotropic positional nystagmuses in patients with H-BPPV were classified as transient geotropic positional nystagmus with a TC of ≤35 s or PGN with a TC of >35 s. Alternatively, the TC of persistent apogeotropic positional nystagmus (AN) in patients with H-BPPV was >35 s. The direction of the SPV of patients with PGN was opposite to that of patients with AN at each head position across the range of neutral head positions. The relationship between the SPV of patients with PGN and the angle of head rotation was linearly symmetrical against that of patients with AN with respect to a line drawn on the neutral head position. Since its TC was >35 s, it is suggested that PGN is induced by cupula deviation in response to gravity at each head position. It is also suggested that the direction of cupula deviation in patients with PGN is opposite to that of patients with AN across the neutral head positional range with no nystagmus where the long axis of cupula is in alignment with the axis of gravity. Since the pathophysiological basis of AN is considered a heavy cupula, it is suggested that PGN is conversely induced by a light cupula.</td>

	<td>Dizziness and imbalance are amongst the most common complaints in older people, and are a growing public health concern since they put older people at a significantly higher risk of falling. Although the causes of dizziness in older people are multifactorial, peripheral vestibular dysfunction is one of the most frequent causes. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most frequent form of vestibular dysfunction in the elderly, followed by Meniere's disease. Every factor associated with the maintenance of postural stability deteriorates during aging. Age-related deterioration of peripheral vestibular function has been demonstrated through quantitative measurements of the vestibulo-ocular reflex with rotational testing and of the vestibulo-collic reflex with testing of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Age-related decline of vestibular function has been shown to correlate with the age-related decrease in the number of vestibular hair cells and neurons. The mechanism of age-related cellular loss in the vestibular endorgan is unclear, but it is thought that genetic predisposition and cumulative effect of oxidative stress may both play an important role. Since the causes of dizziness in older people are multi-factorial, management of this disease should be customized according to the etiologies of each individual. Vestibular rehabilitation is found to be effective in treating both unilateral and bilateral vestibular dysfunction. Various prosthetic devices have also been developed to improve postural balance in older people. Although there have been no medical treatments improving age-related vestibular dysfunction, new medical treatments such as mitochondrial antioxidants or caloric restriction, which have been effective in preventing age-related hearing loss, should be ienvestigated in the future. </td>

	<td>Acute dizziness/vertigo is among the most common causes for visiting the emergency department. The traditional approach to dizziness starts with categorizing dizziness into four types: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and nonspecific dizziness. However, a recently proposed approach begins with classifying dizziness/vertigo as acute prolonged spontaneous dizziness/vertigo, recurrent spontaneous dizziness/vertigo, recurrent positional vertigo, or chronic persistent dizziness and imbalance. Vestibular neuritis and stroke are key disorders causing acute prolonged spontaneous dizziness/vertigo, but the diagnosis of isolated vascular vertigo has increased by virtue of developments in clinical neurotology and neuroimaging. However, a well-organized bedside examination appears more sensitive than brain imaging in diagnosing strokes presenting with acute dizziness/vertigo. A detailed history is vital to diagnose recurrent spontaneous dizziness/vertigo since confirmatory diagnostic tests are usually unavailable. Isolated positional vertigo is usually caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which can be treated at the bedside. In recent years, marked progress has occurred in the evaluation/management of acute dizziness/vertigo. However, even with developments in imaging technology, the diagnosis of acute dizziness/vertigo largely relies on bedside examination.</td>

Although head trauma, migraine, long-term bed rest, Ménière disease, viral labyrinthitis, and upper respiratory tract infections are believed to be predisposing factors, most cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are idiopathic. Ear surgery is another cause, but after non-otologic surgery, attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are rare. We describe three cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo attacks after non-otologic surgery (one patient after a nasal septoplasty and two patients after dental endodontic treatment) and discuss the pathophysiological mechanism of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo seen after non-otologic surgery, its diagnosis and treatment. </td>

	<td>To estimate the ability of bedside information to risk stratify stroke in acute dizziness presentations. Surveillance methods were used to identify patients with acute dizziness and nystagmus or imbalance, excluding those with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, medical causes, or moderate to severe neurologic deficits. Stroke was defined as acute infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage on a clinical or research MRI performed within 14 days of dizziness onset. Bedside information comprised history of stroke, the ABCD(2) score (age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration, and diabetes), an ocular motor (OM)-based assessment (head impulse test, nystagmus pattern [central vs other], test of skew), and a general neurologic examination for other CNS features. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of the bedside information with stroke. Model calibration was assessed using low (<5%), intermediate (5% to <10%), and high (≥10%) predicted probability risk categories. Acute stroke was identified in 29 of 272 patients (10.7%). Associations with stroke were as follows: ABCD(2) score (continuous) (odds ratio [OR] 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.51), any other CNS features (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.06-6.08), OM assessment (OR 2.82; 95% CI 0.96-8.30), and prior stroke (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.05-4.57). No stroke cases were in the model's low-risk probability category (0/86, 0%), whereas 9 were in the moderate-risk category (9/94, 9.6%) and 20 were in the high-risk category (20/92, 21.7%). In acute dizziness presentations, the combination of ABCD(2) score, general neurologic examination, and a specialized OM examination has the capacity to risk-stratify acute stroke on MRI.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) presentations are unique opportunities to simultaneously improve the effectiveness and efficiency of care. The test and treatment for BPPV--the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT) and the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM), respectively--are supported by two evidence-based guidelines (American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery and American Academy of Neurology). With these processes, patients can be readily identified and treated at the bedside, quickly and without expensive tests. Patients randomized to the CRM have a cure rate of 80% at 24 h, compared to only 10% of controls. Despite this large effect size, less than 10% of affected patients receive the treatment, which shows that the management of BPPV in routine care is suboptimal. Future research is necessary to disseminate and implement the DHT and the CRM into routine practice.</td>

	<td>To evaluate utricular and saccular function during the acute and resolved phases of BPPV, ocular and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) were studied in 112 patients with BPPV and 50 normal controls in a referral-based University Hospital. Ocular (oVEMPs) and cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs) were induced using air-conducted sound (1000Hz tone burst, 100dB normal hearing level) at the time of initial diagnosis and 2 months after successful repositioning in patients with BPPV, and the results were compared with those of the controls. Abnormalities of cVEMPs and oVEMPs in patients with BPPV were prevalent and significantly higher compare to the healthy control group (p<0.01 in each VEMP by chi-square test). In the patient group, difference between the proportions of abnormal responses of cVEMP and oVEMP was not significant in both affected (p=0.37, chi-squared test) and non-affected (p=1.00) ears. The abnormalities were more likely reduced or absent responses rather than delayed ones; reduced or absent responses are 17.6% in cVEMPs (p=0.04, chi-square) and 21.6% in oVEMPs (p<0.01). The non-affected ear in the BPPV group also showed significantly higher abnormalities of cVEMP and oVEMP when compared to the control group. The follow-up VEMPs after repositioning maneuvers were not significantly different compared to the initial values from both stimulated affected and non-affected ears. Although most patients had unilateral BPPV, bilateral otolithic dysfunction was often shown by persistently reduced or absent cervical and ocular VEMPs, suggesting that BPPV may be caused by significant bilateral damage to the otolith organs.</td>

The aim of this study was to introduce a simple method of evaluating patients with cupulopathy (light cupula and heavy cupula), which is performed in a seated position, and investigate its diagnostic utility and use for lateralization. Retrospective case series. Using video-oculography, nystagmus during head roll in the leaning and bending head positions while seated upright was evaluated in 26 patients with cupulopathy (five light cupula and 21 heavy cupula). The diagnosis of cupulopathy was confirmed with the supine head-roll test. Spontaneous nystagmus while seated upright was directed toward the ipsilesional side in heavy cupula and the contralesional side in light cupula. The first null point was identified when the head was slightly bent in the pitch plane in all 26 patients. Head rolling elicited a persistent geotropic DCPN in light cupula patients and persistent apogeotropic DCPN in heavy cupula patients during both leaning and bending head positions. In both light and heavy cupula, nystagmus disappeared when the head was turned slightly toward the affected side in both leaning (second null point) and bending (third null point) head positions. Cupulopathy and its affected side can be diagnosed by identifying the three null points while seated upright. 4.</td>

For sudden SNHL with a recent vertigo, patients underwent electronystagmography and bithermal caloric tests. We investigated the clinical characteristics including causes, type of involved semicircular canal, frequency of CRPs, treatment results, and canal paresis (CP). The diagnosis of BPPV accompanied by same-sided sudden SNHL was based on the results of head roll and Dix-Hallpike tests. Of 277 patients with BPPV, 24 (8.7%) had sudden SNHL. Multiple-canal involvement most commonly developed in post-sudden SNHL BPPV (p < 0.01). Patients with post-sudden SNHL BPPV received a greater number of CRPs (2.95) than those with idiopathic BPPV (1.58) (p = 0.043). In patients with post-sudden SNHL BPPV, the average number of CRPs was 3.31 in the presence of CP and 2.1 sessions in the absence of CP (p = 0.030); the CP value was correlated with the frequency of CRPs (p = 0.020). In post-sudden SNHL BPPV, the worse the canal paresis becomes, the greater the number of CRPs will be needed for treatment; the simultaneous involvement of the posterior semicircular canal and horizontal semicircular canal is most common.</td>

	<td>A nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study. To investigate whether benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is associated with an increased risk of fracture. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a brief rotational vertigo induced by head position change that may increase the risk of falls and, therefore, fracture. Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used for this study. We selected a case cohort comprising 3796 patients aged over 20 years who were newly diagnosed with BPPV between 2000 and 2006. In addition, we randomly selected a control cohort of 15 184 individuals without BPPV. Patients with BPPV were matched to individuals in the control group according to sex, age, and index year. A Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to compute the hazard ratio of fracture, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The prevalence of comorbidities was higher among patients with BPPV. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, patients with BPPV exhibited a 1.14-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.25; P<.01) higher risk of fracture than those without BPPV. Trunk fracture (vertebra, rib, and pelvis) was the fracture type with the highest adjusted hazard ratio (1.24; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.45; P<.01) in patients with BPPV relative to those without BPPV. An analysis stratified according to demographic factors revealed that men with BPPV exhibited a 1.43-fold (95% CI: 1.22, 1.66; P<.001) higher risk of fracture. Patients with BPPV aged over 65 years exhibited a significantly higher risk of fracture (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.33; P<.05) than did those without BPPV. Patients with BPPV exhibited a higher risk of fracture than did those without BPPV. Prognosis, level 2b.</td>

	<td>BPPV is generally the most common cause of vertigo, caused by a pinch-off of tiny calcium carbonate crystals (called the otoconia or the otoliths) from the macula utriculi, most frequently due to the degenerative processes or a trauma, whereby the crystals, under the action of gravity in certain head positions coinciding with its direction, arrive to some of the semicircular canals, usually the posterior one, due to the existent anatomical circumstances and relationships, thus creating an inadequate stimulus of the cupular senses while floating through the endolymph and provoking symptoms of a strong and short-term dizziness. Two main clinical forms can be distinguished: canalolythiasis, with an accommodation of otolithic debris in the semicircular canal, and cupulolythiasis, with their location immediately next to the cupular sense. The diagnosis is established by a positive positioning test, Dix-Hallpike for the posterior and the supine roll for the lateral canal. Although one can expect a spontaneous recovery subsequent to few weeks or months, various methods of otolith repositioning to a less sensitive place lead to a prompt improvement while reducing or withdrawing the symptoms completely. These guidelines are intended for all who treat the BPPV in their work, with an intention to assist in the diagnosis and application of an appropriate therapeutic method.</td>

The chair together with the patients was atomatically displaced during the rotation 3.5--4.0 cm to the right or left off the vertical axis, and the error in subjective perception of the deviation from the vertical was estimated. The saccular function was evaluated by recording cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. The symptoms of BPPD were found to completely disappear after the eccentric rotation.

	<td>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2007 and previously updated in 2011.Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) can occur as a result of disease, trauma or postoperatively. The dysfunction is characterised by complaints of dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical manoeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation. To assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in the adult, community-dwelling population of people with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The most recent search was 18 January 2014. Randomised controlled trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We sought comparisons of vestibular rehabilitation versus control (e.g. placebo), other treatment (non-vestibular rehabilitation, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of vestibular rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measure was change in the specified symptomatology (for example, proportion with dizziness resolved, frequency or severity of dizziness). Secondary outcomes were measures of function, quality of life and/or measure(s) of physiological status, where reproducibility has been confirmed and shown to be relevant or related to health status (for example, posturography), and adverse effects We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 39 studies involving 2441 participants with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders in the review. Trials addressed the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation against control/sham interventions, medical interventions or other forms of vestibular rehabilitation. Non-blinding of outcome assessors and selective reporting were threats that may have biased the results in 25% of studies, but otherwise there was a low risk of selection or attrition bias.Individual and pooled analyses of the primary outcome, frequency of dizziness, showed a statistically significant effect in favour of vestibular rehabilitation over control or no intervention (odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 3.86; four studies, 565 participants). Secondary outcomes measures related to levels of activity or participation measured, for example, with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which also showed a strong trend towards significant differences between the groups (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.64). The exception to this was when movement-based vestibular rehabilitation was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49). There were no reported adverse effects. There is moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that vestibular rehabilitation resolves symptoms and improves functioning in the medium term. However, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

	<td>Dizziness and vertigo are among the most common presenting patient complaints in ambulatory settings. Specific vestibular causes are often not immediately identifiable. The first task of the clinician is to attempt to rule in specific vestibular disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo through physical examination, diagnostic testing, and history taking. A large proportion of patients with dizziness and vertigo will not be easily classified or confirmed as having a specific vestibular cause. As with any undifferentiated patient, the focus in this setting is to attempt to exclude serious or threatening causes. </td>

	<td>The majority of patients who present to the Emergency Department with vertigo suffer from benign conditions. However, a few percent of these patients have life-threatening conditions, such as a cerebellar stroke. The HINTS clinical decision rule (Head-Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test-of-Skew) allows the physician to identify patients with an acute vestibular syndrome of central origin. HINTS is more sensitive than early magnetic resonance imaging. There is no role for computed tomography in the evaluation of patients with isolated acute vestibular syndrome in the Emergency Department. For patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, simple reposition maneuvers are effective for symptom relief. </td>

	<td>The purpose of the present study is to explore, demonstrate, and describe the expression of genes related to the solute carrier (SLC) molecules of ion transporters in the human endolymphatic sac. cDNA microarrays and immunohistochemistry were used for analyses of fresh human endolymphatic sac tissue samples. Twelve tissue samples of the human endolymphatic sac were obtained during translabyrinthine surgery for vestibular schwannoma. Microarray technology was used to investigate tissue sample expression of solute carrier family genes, using adjacent dura mater as control. Immunohistochemistry was used for verification of translation of selected genes, as well as localization of the specific protein within the sac. An extensive representation of the SLC family genes were upregulated in the human endolymphatic sac, including SLC26a4 Pendrin, SLC4a1 sodium-bicarbonate transporter, SLC9a2 sodium-hydrogen transporter, SLC12a3 thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl transporter, and SLC34a2 sodium-phosphate transporter. Several important ion transporters of the SLC family are expressed in the human endolymphatic sac, including Pendrin, the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl transporter, and the Na-phosphate transporter SLC34a2. The data provide a new knowledge base considering the ion-dependent metabolic mechanisms maintaining inner ear homeostasis. More specifically, the results indicate a strong similarity with the ion transportation occurring in the kidney collecting ducts. In addition, the findings prompt a revision of the theories behind contemporary pharmacological treatment of Ménière's disease and may broaden the understanding of the pathogenesis of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Balance disorders presenting with symptoms of dizziness or vertigo may have significant impact on quality of life and are a recognized risk factor for falls. The objective of this review was to systematically synthesize the published literature on the epidemiology of balance symptoms and disorders in the adult community population. A search was carried out across PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases to identify suitable studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they contained data on the epidemiology of symptoms of balance disorders (dizziness and vertigo) or balance disorders sampled from community-based adult populations. Data were collected on prevalence and incidence of balance symptoms and on specific balance disorders. A validated risk-of-bias assessment was carried out. Twenty eligible studies were identified. The lifetime prevalence estimates of significant dizziness ranged between 17 and 30%, and for vertigo between 3 and 10%. Published point prevalence data exist for Ménière's disease (0.12-0.5%) and for vestibular migraine (0.98%). For benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 1-year incidence estimates range from 0.06 to 0.6%. There are no community-based studies on the prevalence or incidence of chronic uncompensated peripheral vestibular disorders or vestibular neuritis. Symptoms of dizziness and vertigo are common in the adult population, and data give a coherent picture of community epidemiology. These data can inform rational service planning and much-needed clinical trials in this field. There are insufficient data on specific balance disorders, especially peripheral vestibular disorders such as vestibular neuritis and its long-term sequelae.</td>

The characteristic nystagmus is positional, down-beating, with a torsional component elicited by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Symptoms of superior semicircular canal BPPV often resolve spontaneously; however, it can be refractory to repositioning maneuvers. Surgical management is described for posterior semicircular canal BPPV. To date, however, there is only one reported case of surgical management for superior semicircular canal BPPV. Here we show video documentation of positional, down-beating nystagmus and describe a case of superior semicircular canal BPPV requiring canal occlusion with successful resolution of symptoms.</td>

Furthermore, we speculated on the possible mechanism of spontaneous inversion of nystagmus without a positional change. The characteristics of spontaneous inversion of positional nystagmus without a positional change were analyzed in 7 patients with HC-BPPV. All patients were diagnosed as having HC-BPPV. During the positional test, the spontaneous inversion of nystagmus was observed in the same head position in all patients. Spontaneous inversion was observed on both sides in 5 patients, and only on 1 side in 2 patients. All patients presented with geotropic nystagmus in the first phase, and ageotropic nystagmus in the second phase. The coexistence of cupulolithiasis and canalolithiasis appears to be a possible mechanism of the spontaneous inversion of positional nystagmus.</td>

One half of the students used a real iPhone application, whereas the others used a sham application. The PRM performance scores of the 2 groups were compared. iPhone application users scored significantly higher on their PRM performance compared with controls (P < .0001) and performed the PRM significantly more slowly (P < .0001). Senior medical students performed a more correct PRM when assisted by the iPhone application. This application represents a significant improvement from standard medical school training using written instructions. Family physicians could also use this iPhone application for the quick and effective treatment of BPPV.</td>

We observed otolith abnormal migration complicating during diagnosis and treatment. According the type of otolith abnormal migration, the additional repositioning maneuver was performed. The rate of complication was 8. 1%(39/479), with canal conversion in 5.4%(26/479) and primarily canal reentry in 2.7%(13/479). The rate of incidence of conversion to horizontal canal conversion and anterior canal were 4. 8%(23/479)and 0. 6%(3/479) respectively. All the patient was cured in follow up. The risk factors were unappropriated head movement during or after CRP, including another Dix-Hallpike were performed immediately. To prevent the complications,the pathognostic positioning sequence and angle of head rotation are commenced during CRP. Appropriate short time postural restrictions post-treatment is necessary.

	<td>Vertigo is a common cause of emergency department attendance. Detection of spontaneous nystagmus may be a useful sign in distinguishing vestibular neuritis from other vestibular diagnoses. We aimed to assess the contribution of spontaneous nystagmus in the diagnosis of acute vertigo. We enrolled consecutive consenting patients arriving at a single emergency department with acute vertigo. There was no declared protocol for the emergency department staff. A standardized history and examination was conducted by the investigators. Observation for spontaneous nystagmus, its response to visual fixation, and testing the vestibulo-ocular reflex with the horizontal head impulse test were the chief examination components. MRI was obtained within 24 hours. Clinical criteria and MRI were used to reach the final diagnosis. The investigators' physical findings and final neurological diagnosis were compared with the initial emergency department examination findings and the referral diagnosis. There were 28 patients, 15 with vestibular neuritis, six with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, one with stroke, suspected clinically, and three with migraine. In three the diagnosis remained uncertain. Spontaneous nystagmus was seen in all 15 patients with vestibular neuritis, fixation-suppressed in eight of 11 tested for this. The head impulse test was positive in 12 of 15 with vestibular neuritis. The emergency department referral diagnosis was correct in six of 23 patients. The ability to detect spontaneous nystagmus is useful in vestibular diagnosis, both in support of a diagnosis of vestibular neuritis and in avoiding false positive diagnoses of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

Retrospective analysis of medical records of t-BPPV cases among patients suffering from BPPV. Among 3060 patients with a clinical diagnosis of BPPV, we reviewed 716 clinical cases in which a clear association to a traumatic event was present. A traumatic event was identified in 23.4% of total enrolled BPPV patients. Some minor head traumas could be more prone to determine BPPV in females. We confirmed that t-BPPV appeared significantly more difficult to treat than idiopathic form. Posterior canal t-BPPV cases required more treatment sessions before obtaining therapeutic success, while horizontal ones recovered at most after two repositioning maneuvers. Post-traumatic BPPV is considered one of the most common known etiologies. An accurate understanding of trauma mechanism, gender prevalence, and therapeutic success rates of each event, could be useful in adequately treating and planning follow-up examinations.</td>

	<td>Fatigue is characterized by weariness unrelated to exertion levels. It has been reported in chronic neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease and stroke. Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often complain about fatigue during a vertigo attack. No attention has been paid to this symptom in the literature so far. We were interested to evaluate the frequency and factors influencing fatigue in BPPV. Patients treated for idiopathic BPPV during the years 2011-2012 were prospectively evaluated for the presence of fatigue. During the first visit, patients were asked to complete two questionnaires based on their experience during the last week: the Fatigue severity scale and the Hospital anxiety and depression scale. Patients' demographic data and BPPV characteristics were registered. Among 172 patients treated for BPPV, 40 (23.2 %) reported fatigue. The mean fatigue score was 4.73 ± 1.98 indicating moderate fatigue. No correlation was found between fatigue and anxiety or fatigue and depression. Fatigue scores were inversely related to age (r = -0.36, p = 0.020) and were not dependent on the type of BPPV, its recurrence, background diseases, gender, duration of vertigo or the presence of autonomic symptoms. Moderate fatigue is quite common during an attack of BPPV. It seems to be a genuine symptom of the entity that might worsen patients' distress. For severe or persistent fatigue treatment with fatigue relieving drugs such as amantadine, methylphenidate or modafinil could be tried in the future.</td>

The goal of this paper is to review the pharmacological profile of betahistine and the evidence for its effectiveness and safety in the treatment of peripheral vertigo. Selection criteria for the publications on betahistine included randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of betahistine vs placebo or active control in the treatment of peripheral vertigo. Recent meta-analyses were also included. Databases searched included PubMed, the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, and ICTRP. The review also presents an update on the mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of betahistine. Efficacy and safety of betahistine has been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials. The precise mechanism of action of betahistine is still not completely understood, but the clinical experience demonstrated the benefit of betahistine in different types of peripheral vertigo. In more than 40 years of clinical use, betahistine has shown an excellent safety profile with the usual dose range from 8-48 mg daily. According to clinical studies, betahistine 48 mg daily during 3 months is an effective and safe option for the treatment of peripheral vertigo.</td>

A 30-year-old woman had undergone direct sinus lift procedure by lateral window technique to replace her missing right molar with dental implant. The patient suffered with intense vertigo with nausea, vomiting, and aggravated when she changed the position of her head towards right immediately after procedure and was diagnosed with BPPV after the referral. We assume that prolonged hyperextended head position of iatrogenic origin can be the reason, in this case, for BPPV after direct lateral sinus lift procedure. There is also a possibility that the temporal relationship with the surgical area and surgical action by rotating tools during window preparation are also contributing factors.</td>

The objective of this study is to identify and characterize matrix proteins associated with the eggshell mammillary cones, which are hypothesized to regulate the earliest stage of eggshell calcification. Mammillary cones were isolated from 2 models, fertilized and unfertilized, and the released proteins were identified by RP-nanoLC and ES-MS/MS proteomics. Proteomics analysis identified 49 proteins associated with the eggshell membrane fibers and, importantly, 18 mammillary cone-specific proteins with an additional 18 proteins identified as enriched in the mammillary cones. Among the most promising candidates for modulating protein-crystal interactions were extracellular matrix proteins, including ABI family member 3 (NESH) binding protein (ABI3BP), tiarin-like, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3), collagen alpha-1(X), collagen alpha-1(II) and fibronectin, in addition to the calcium binding proteins calumenin, EGF-like repeats and discoidin 1-like domains 3 (EDIL3), nucleobindin-2 and SPARC. In conclusion, we identified several cone-resident proteins that are candidates to regulate initiation of eggshell calcification. Further study of these proteins will determine their roles in modulating calcitic biomineralization and lead to insight into the process of otoconia formation/regeneration. Biomineralization is essential for the development of hard tissues in vertebrates, which includes both calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate structures. Calcitic mineralization by calcium carbonate is an important process in the formation of otoconia, which are gravity receptor organs located in the inner ear and are responsible for balance and for sensing linear acceleration. Deficiencies in the regulation of their biomineralization can lead to otoconia degeneration and eventually benign paroxysmal position vertigo (BPPV), which is the main cause of vertigo in humans. Eggshell formation in chicken is one of the fastest known biomineralization processes and is an excellent model for the study of calcitic biomineralization. Cross-analysis of proteomic data from two mineralized models, fertilized and unfertilized chicken eggshells, identified proteins associated with the mammillary cones that are the sites of initiation of eggshell formation. We hypothesize that these proteins regulate the earliest stages of eggshell calcification. The human homologs of these proteins are therefore potential candidates to play a role in otoconia biomineralization.</td>

	<td>To test the hypothesis that levels of a BPPV biomarker, otolin-1, correlate with those of osteoporosis markers, aminoterminal propeptide of protocollagen type I (P1NP), and aminoterminal telopeptides of collagen (NTX), thus further supporting a link between the two diseases. Prospective pilot clinical trial (Level of Evidence: 2b). Postmenopausal women with BPPV. Diagnostic. Serum levels of otolin-1, P1NP, NTX, vitamin D, and calcium were examined in relation to each other, age, and DEXA scan T-scores. There was a strong, negative correlation between T-scores and otolin-1 levels. Although P1NP and NTX levels were strongly correlated, neither had statistical correlations with otolin-1. Despite a strong correlation between DEXA scan results and otolin-1 levels, there were no significant correlations between otolin-1 and P1NP or NTX. This suggests that the association between osteoporosis and BPPV is complex, but not likely to be causal. Although more work is needed to elucidate these relationships, this preliminary finding has important practical implications for BPPV in that proactive management of osteoporosis, per se, would not be expected to have benefits in management of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Although there have been few studies concerning BPPV and thyroid autoimmunity and a positive relation was found between them, this study didn't find any relation between BPPV and thyroid autoimmunity. IT is thought that further large-scale studies must be done to clarify the relation. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) consists of ∼ 20% of vestibular disorders. Self-limited rotatory nystagmus with positional vertigo are the main findings of BPPV. Although canalolithiasis theory was confirmed by demonstrating freely floating debris in the endolymph of the posterior semicircular channel in following studies, currently, the etiology hasn't been explained totally. This study investigated the relation of BPPV and thyroid autoimmunity evaluated via measurement of serum thyroid autoantibodies. Fifty patients (37 female, 13 male) with BPPV (BPPV group), 52 patients (40 female, 12 male) with non-BPPV vertigo (non-BPPV group) and 60 otherwise normal control (38 female, 22 male) samples were enrolled in the study. All samples of BPPV, non-BPPV groups and controls had undergone a cochleovestibular test following thorough ENT examination. After blood samples were drawn from each subject, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TG-Ab) levels were measured accordingly. In the study, eight patients of the BPPV group (16%) had a high thyroid antibody level. In the non-BPPV group, six patients (11.5%) had elevated thyroid antibodies. In the control group, 15 patients (25%) had elevated thyroid antibodies. TSH values of all subjects were detected to be within normal range. No statistical difference was found between the groups with respect to TG-Ab and TPO-Ab values (p-values = 0.729 and 0.812, respectively).</td>

	<td>Introduction Poor diet habits and inadequate intake of nutrients are a concern in the elderly. Nutritional education with guidance may improve the results of the treatment of vertigo. Objective Evaluate the presence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) associated with feeding habits. Methods Cross-sectional study with elderly people living independently. We evaluated nutritional habits through the method of dietary 24-hour recall and manipulation of Dix-Hallpike. Results Based on a sample of 487 individuals, 117 had BPPV. Among the 117 elderly patients with BPPV, 37 (31.62%) had inadequate feeding. From those 370 individuals without BPPV, 97 (26.21%) had inappropriate feeding. No significant association between nutritional habits and BPPV in the total population was observed (p = 0.3064). However, there was significant relation between BPPV and inadequate carbohydrate intake (p = 0.0419) and insufficient fiber intake (p = 0.03), and the diet of these subjects was rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.0084). Conclusion These data correlate with the dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia status, making it extremely important to reduce the intake of fats and carbohydrates and increase the fiber intake to stabilize triglycerides and thus minimize harmful effects on the inner ear. Food readjustment is suggested in patients with BPPV, along with the work of a multidisciplinary team to improve the quality of the elderly. </td>

For both conditions, early and accurate diagnosis (or its exclusion) enables the correct management of patients with acute episodic vestibular symptoms. Long-term management of migraine requires changes in lifestyle to avoid triggers of migraine and/or prophylactic drugs if attacks become too frequent. The long-term management of Ménière's disease also involves lifestyle changes (low salt diet), medications (betahistine, steroids), and ablative therapy applied to the diseased ear (eg, intratympanic gentamicin). </td>

Fifty-two patients (aged 32-80 yr; mean, 55.9 yr; 18 men and 34 women) were treated with CMRM that was composed of three sequential 360-degree rotations and 48 patients (aged 30-71 yr; mean, 52.4 yr; 20 men and 28 women) treated with RM that consisted of one 360-degree rotation. Resolution of vertigo on the supine roll test at 48 hours after initial maneuver and the number of maneuvers required for final resolution of vertigo were main outcome measures to assess the efficacy of treatment. On the supine roll test at 48-hour follow-up after initial maneuver, 44 (84.6%) of 52 CMRM-treated patients and 23 (54.2%) of 48 RM-treated patients had resolution of vertigo (p < 0.01). All patients obtained final resolution of vertigo with a maximum of five maneuvers in each group, but the CMRM group had less mean number of maneuvers required for final resolution of vertigo compared with the RM group (1.23 ± 0.39 versus 1.63 ± 0.68, p < 0.05). No significant adverse effects and complications occurred aside from two patients with conversion into posterior canal BPPV in each treatment.

Resolution of vertigo and nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test at 1-week follow-up after treatment was the main outcome measure to assess the efficacy of treatment. At 1-week follow-up after treatment with computer-controlled CRP, 108 (81.8%) of 132 patients had complete resolution of vertigo and nystagmus, nine (6.8%) had resolution of vertigo but presence of nystagmus, and 15 (11.4%) had provoked vertigo and nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. The 81.8% success rate was comparable to those who received current standard CRP treatment in randomized controlled trials at about 80%. No significant adverse effects or complications occurred in the patients treated with computer-controlled CRP, aside from two patients (1.5%) with conversion into lateral canal BPPV. Computer-controlled CRP is effective for the treatment of posterior canal BPPV, with a success rate similar to those treated with the Epley maneuver, and is safe and easy to perform on patients.</td>

All patients were asked to answer a detailed interview about the onset time of positional vertigo and to visit the hospital every 1-3 days. At every visit, they were interviewed about cessation time of positional vertigo and positional nystagmus was assessed. The mean period ± SD between the onset and remission of vertigo in the h-BPPV (Geo) was 6.7 ± 6.3 days, whereas that in the h-BPPV (Apo) was 3.7 ± 4.1 days. In addition, the mean period ± SD from the initial diagnosis to the disappearance of positional nystagmus in the h-BPPV (Geo) was 4.7 ± 3.9 days, whereas that in the h-BPPV (Apo) was 4.4 ± 5.0 days. Although the duration until natural remission of positional nystagmus did not differ between the two variants of h-BPPV, the remission of vertigo occurred faster in h-BPPV (Apo) than h-BPPV (Geo) (p < 0.05). The natural course of h-BPPV is much shorter than that indicated in previous reports. The positional vertigo disappeared faster in the h-BPPV (Apo) compared to the h-BPPV (Geo) unlike the positional nystagmus.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most common vestibular disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4%. This study aimed to assess age, gender, lesion type and site, association with other vestibular diseases, progression and recurrence in a Portuguese population. This was a retrospective observational study of 101 patients diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo by the same senior doctor, in a tertiary academic hospital, between January 2009 and May 2011. A total of 101 cases were pooled, with a mean age of 56.57±15.33 years (15-90 years). From these, 72.3% were women. The posterior canal was affected in 72.3%, the lateral in 24.7%, the anterior in 2% and multiple canals in 1%. Unilateral canal and left labyrinth involvement were more frequent. The therapeutic maneuver used most was Epley's. Recurrence was observed in 10.9% of the cases. It was idiopathic in 83.2% of cases. No association was found between the number of maneuvers necessary to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and etiology. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more frequent in female subjects, in the 6th decade and involves preferably the posterior semicircular canal of the right labyrinth. In most cases it is idiopathic and treatment with repositioning maneuvers has a mean success of 90%. Our results were in accordance with the literature; nevertheless, in this study the left labyrinth was most affected and the follow-up period was variable.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a unilateral peripheral vestibular pathology, mostly involving the semicircular canals and the otolith organs. Although equivocal findings exist on the utility of cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential in identifying BPPV-associated changes in saccule, ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP), which is primarily a utricular response, has sparingly been explored in this population. Hence, the present study aimed at examining oVEMP in individuals with BPPV and comparing them with healthy individuals to illustrate its efficacy in identifying BPPV-associated changes in the utricle. Using a case-control design, oVEMPs were elicited by 500 Hz tone bursts at 125 dB peak sound pressure level and recorded bilaterally from 30 individuals with unilateral posterior canal BPPV and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. There were no inter- or intragroup differences in latency aspects (p > 0.05); however, amplitudes were significantly smaller in BPPV ears compared with the non-BPPV ears of individuals with BPPV as well as ears of healthy controls (p < 0.05). Exceptions to this were five participants with BPPV in whom the affected ears demonstrated larger response amplitude (augmentation) than the unaffected ears. Furthermore, there was significantly larger interaural amplitude ratio in individuals with BPPV compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.05). Interaural amplitude ratio produced the largest effect size among the oVEMP parameters for differentiating BPPV from healthy controls. Large asymmetry ratio of oVEMP, usually exceeding 26.8%, is the most potent characteristic of oVEMP in BPPV. Abnormal oVEMP results confirm utricular pathology in ears with BPPV, and therefore, oVEMP can be used as an objective tool with asymmetry ratio as the parameter of choice for the evaluation of utricular function in persons with posterior canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) could be treated with specific maneuvers for the involved canals. Management on a daily basis gave earlier relief than weekly treatment, especially in apogeotropic BPPV. Apogeotropic and multi-canal BPPVs were related to the increased numbers of follow-ups and trauma was related to the increased recurrence. We aimed to report the short-term outcomes of our protocol for BPPV and evaluate the factors influencing the results and recurrence. In 210 BPPV patients, posterior semicircular canal (PSCC), geotropic and apogeotropic lateral canal BPPVs were treated with the Epley maneuver, barbecue maneuver, and barbecue maneuver after head-shaking. The total number of follow-ups needed to have no provoked nystagmus, success rates at 1 week and 1 month, and factors for repeated maneuvers or recurrence were identified. Apogeotropic and multi-canal BPPV needed more follow-ups than PSCC BPPV. Multi-canal BPPV showed a significantly lower 1-week success rate than other types. Anterior and multi-canal BPPV showed significantly lower 1-month success rates than other types. The 1-week success rates for PSCC and geotropic and apogeotropic BPPV in patients followed up on a daily basis were higher than those in patients with weekly follow-up and the difference was significant only in apogeotropic BPPV. The overall 1-year recurrence rate was 16% and higher recurrence rate was related to trauma.</td>

	<td>Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) is an emerging tool to diagnose Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The clinical utility of VEMP has been reported only in small accord in Indian literature. To study the latency and amplitude of VEMP in patients with BPPV and compare it with that of normal subjects. The study included two groups. Group one (control group) were 18 normal subjects. Group two (test group) were 15 subjects with unilateral BPPV. Those subjects who fulfilled the selection criteria based on case history and audiological assessment were taken for the VEMP recording. The VEMP response consist of positive and negative successive waves (pI-nI), with latency values in adults about 13 and 23 milliseconds respectively. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12 (Chicago, IL, USA). Unpaired t-test was employed to measure the statistical difference between control group and test group. The difference in n23 and the peak to peak amplitude between the ipsilateral and contralateral ears of the test group were statistically significant, whereas such a difference in the p13 latency turned out to be statistically insignificant. It should be noted that, out of 15 patients in the test group, five patients showed only artifact tracer recordings in both the ears which is considered as no response. The heterogeneity of the results extended from absence of VEMP to prolongation of both p13, n23; prolongation of p13 alone; and even side to side variations. Absent response from the ipsilateral ear, prolonged latency of n23 and decreased peak to peak amplitude (p13, n23), indicates the disease pathology. However, large sample size is required to draw further conclusions and to consolidate the usage of VEMP in the diagnosis of BPPV.</td>

	<td>There are currently eight groups of drugs for the pharmacotherapy of vertigo, nystagmus, and cerebellar disorders: antiemetics; anti-inflammatories, antimenieres, and antimigraineous medications; antidepressants, anticonvulsants, aminopyridines, and acetyl-DL-leucine ("the eight A's"). In acute unilateral vestibulopathy, corticosteroids improve the recovery of peripheral vestibular function, but there is not sufficient current evidence for a general recommendation. There is also insufficient evidence that 48 or 144 mg/day betahistine has an effect in Ménière's disease. Therefore, higher dosages are currently recommended; in animal studies, it was shown that betahistine increases cochlear blood flow. In vestibular paroxysmia, oxcarbazepine was effective (one yet not randomized controlled trial (RCT)). Aminopyridines are recommended for the treatment of downbeat nystagmus (two RCTs) and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2, one RCT). There are so far no RCTs on vestibular migraine, so currently no treatment can be recommended. Acetyl-dl-leucine improves cerebellar ataxia (three observational studies); it also accelerates central compensation in an animal model of acute unilateral lesion, but RCTs were negative. There are ongoing RCTs on vestibular paroxysmia with carbamazepine (VESPA), acute unilateral vestibulopathy with betahistine (BETAVEST), vestibular migraine with metoprolol (PROVEMIG), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with vitamin D (VitD@BPPV), EA2 with 4-aminopyridine versus acetazolamide (EAT-2-TREAT), and cerebellar ataxias with acetyl-DL-leucine (ALCAT).</td>

	<td>By analysing the video-nystagmography findings of positional tests,to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the patients with horikontal semicircular canal cupulolithiasis (HSC-Cup). A retrospective study of 36 patients with HSC-Cup. The induced nystagmus in roll tests was recorded by videonystagmography, whose direction, latency, intensity and time characteristics were analysed. All of the 36 patients were treated with lying position avoiding normal side and oral-taken betahistine mesilate tablets. A week later return visits and curative effects evaluation were made. Horizontal apogeotropic nystagmus was induced by turning left or right in HSC-Cup roll tests. The time of latency and duration turning to normal and lesion side were(0. 93 ± 0. 65)s and(1. 01 ± 0. 78)s, (100.58 ± 36. 56)s and (118. 65 ± 143. 71)s, which showed no statistically significant difference (P>0. 05). The duration of nystagmus was more than 60 seconds. The intensity of nystagmus turning to normal and lesion side were(45.58 ± 28.71)°/s and (20.42 ± 16. 64)°/s. The intensity turning to normal side was greater than lesion side obviously. The difference was statistically significant (P<0. 05). Twenty-three patients withright HSC-Cup, and 13 patients with left HSC-Cup were taken in count. They were treated with above methods and return visit a week later. Twenty-eight patients (77. 77%) were cured, 36 patients (100. 00%) were improved. There were 4 patients recurrence during the follow-up. The direction and duration time of induced nystagmus are available to diagnose the HSC-Cup. The lesion side may determined according to the intensity of induced nystagmus. Lying position avoiding normal side and oral-taken betahistine mesilate tablets is an effective treatment methods for HSC-Cup.</td>

	<td>Several studies indicated the association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency implying that abnormal calcium metabolism may underlie BPPV. The aim of the present study is to confirm the correlation between BPPV and both decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and vitamin D deficiency. The study group included 80 patients with idiopathic BPPV (52 females, 28 males), with age range 31-71 years (47.6 ± 9.1). The patients were divided into two groups; recurrent BPPV group including 36 subjects and non-recurrent group including 44 subjects. The control group included 100 healthy volunteers with age and gender distribution similar to the study group. All the subjects in the study were examined using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to assess BMD, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for vitamin D assessment. The accepted normal levels were T-score > -1, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 30 ng/ml. Twenty-six (26 %) subjects showed abnormal T-score in the control group; 26 (59 %) in the non-recurrent BPPV and 22 (61 %) in the recurrent BPPV group. Chi square test showed significant difference between the control group and both BPPV groups. The control group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than the BPPV subgroups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower in the recurrent BPPV than it was in the non-recurrent subgroup (p < 0.05). The results of the current study associate between reduced BMD and development/recurrence of BPPV. Moreover, low levels of vitamin D were related to development of BPPV while very low levels were associated with recurrence of BPPV. The co-occurrence of two morbidities is not by itself supportive of a relationship, but the cumulating studies correlating between BPPV and both vitamin D deficiency and low BMD indicate the investigation and treatment of those disorders in cases with recurrent BPPV.</td>

	<td>The aim of the present study was to explore the demographic, clinical, and pathogenetic features; and treatment outcomes of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) who were negative upon positional testing at their first referral. A total of 133 patients presented with histories of BPPV but were negative, in our hands, upon positional testing. Patients were told to cease taking vestibular suppressant medication (if any) and were to return for re-examination when positional vertigo symptoms recurred. If BPPV was diagnosed, the appropriate repositioning maneuver was applied and patients were re-examined weekly until the characteristic nystagmus and vertigo disappeared. Follow-up was performed 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after diagnosis. The 133 patients were compared with a group of 250 patients with typical BPPV. Sixty-five of the 133 patients (termed the n-BPPV group) were subsequently identified with typical BPPV. Such diagnoses were made within 10 days of the first referral in 37 (56.9%) cases. Patients of the n-BPPV group had a longer duration of the last episode of vertigo than did others (39.7 ± 38.4 vs. 26.1 ± 36.7 days, p < 0.001), and a higher proportion used vestibular suppressant medication prior to first referral (75.4 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.003). The n-BPPV and typical BPPV patients responded similarly to treatment and exhibited similar recurrence rates. BPPV patients who were negative upon positional testing at first referral were quite common, accounting for 26% of all typical BPPV patients. No significant difference in either treatment outcome or recurrence rate was evident between n-BPPV and typical BPPV positions. Positional vertigo and nystagmus are not always present as BPPV progresses.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most frequently encountered primary complaints in dizziness clinics. The incidence of BPPV has been proven to increase with age. The relationship between BPPV and another neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), has not been previously discussed. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of BPPV and PD with oxidative stress. A total of 30,811 subjects participated in our cohort study. The study cohort comprised 5057 BPPV patients and a comparison cohort of 25,754 nonBPPV patients. SIRT1 axis gene expression was investigated in BPPV patient blood samples and a PD cell model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated PC-12 cells to elucidate the potential in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of degeneration in PD and BPPV. Our data suggest that BPPV patients with histories of head injuries show a significantly higher hazard to develop subsequent PD (hazard ratio, 3.942; confidence interval, 1.523-10.205, p = 0.005). We also observed that oxidative status is increased in blood samples from patients with BPPV. Our in vitro study suggests that SIRT1 function is inhibited by oxidative stress, which thereby promotes 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell death. We conclude that BPPV is independently associated with an increased risk of PD. This finding may be attributed to oxidative stress-mediated inhibition of SIRT1 expression levels.</td>

The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of discordant, equivocal, and concordant nystagmus tracings in active posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo when compared directly with the eye video. Case series with chart review of patients diagnosed with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo by 2-dimensional videonystagmography from August 1, 2007, to August 1, 2012. A tertiary vestibular test laboratory. Ninety-six adults (4 had bilateral involvement) with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were included. A total of 100 videos with accompanying videonystagmography tracings were reviewed to determine nystagmus trajectory as well as globe position. Descriptive statistics were used to describe prevalence. Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions. Sixty-two percent of cases involved benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the right posterior semicircular canal, while 38% involved the left posterior semicircular canal. The prevalence of discordant, equivocal, and concordant tracings was 65% (65/100), 29% (29/100), and 6% (6/100). All tracing errors involved the horizontal channel. There was no association between tracing accuracy and the ear of involvement or globe position (P > .05). Two-dimensional videonystagmography tracings are not reliable for identifying nystagmus trajectory in posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Dizziness and vertigo are highly prevalent symptoms among patients presenting at primary care clinics, and peripheral vestibular disorder (PVD) is their most frequent cause. However, the incidence of PVD has not been well documented. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of dizziness, vertigo, and PVD among patients presenting at a primary care clinic. This was an observational study. Between November 2011 and March 2013, we observed 393 patients, all at least 20 years old, who had been treated for chronic diseases such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months at a primary clinic (Oki Clinic) in Japan. The main outcome of interest was new incidence of dizziness, vertigo, and PVD events. During the 1-year follow-up period, the otorhinolaryngologist diagnosed and reported new PVD events. The mean age of the 393 participants at entry was 65.5 years. Of the study participants, 12.7%, 82.4%, and 92.6% had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, respectively. We followed up all the participants (100%). During the 662.5 person-years of follow-up, 121 cases of dizziness or vertigo (dizziness/vertigo) and 76 cases of PVD were observed. The incidence of dizziness/vertigo and PVD was 194.7 (95% confidence interval: 161.6-232.6) per 1,000 person-years and 115.7 (95% confidence interval: 92.2-142.6) per 1,000 person-years, respectively. There were 61 cases of acute peripheral vestibulopathy, 12 of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and three of Meniere's disease among the 76 PVD patients. We reported the incidence of dizziness/vertigo among Japanese primary care clinic patients, which was higher than that usually observed in the general population. Furthermore, we described the incidence of PVD and found that it was a major cause of dizziness/vertigo.</td>

	<td>Changes in carbohydrate metabolism may lead to recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. To evaluate the influence of the disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism in the recurrence of idiopathic BPPV. A longitudinal prospective study of a cohort, with 41 months follow-up. We analyzed the results of 72 glucose-insulin curves in patients with recurrence of BPPV. The curves were classified into intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and normal. The RR for hyperinsulinism was 4.66 and p=0.0015. Existing hyperglycemia showed an RR=2.47, with p=0.0123. Glucose intolerance had a RR of 0.63, with p=0.096. When the examination was within normal limits, the result was RR=0.2225 and p=0.030. Metabolic changes can cause dizziness and vertigo and are very common in people who have cochleovestibular disorders. However, few studies discuss the relationship between idiopathic BPPV and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study, we found that both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for the recurrence of BPPV, whereas a normal test was considered a protective factor; all these were statistically significant. Glucose intolerance that was already present was not statistically significant in the group evaluated. Hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia are risk factors for the recurrence of idiopathic BPPV and a normal exam is considered a protective factor.</td>

	<td>Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is one of the commonly identified congenital temporal bone abnormalities associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, and typically presents at birth or in early childhood. Vestibular symptoms have been reported in up to 50% of affected individuals, and may be delayed in onset until adulthood. The details of nystagmus in patients with EVA have not been previously reported. The objectives were to describe the clinical history, vestibular test findings and nystagmus seen in a case series of patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct anomaly. Chart review, included computed tomography temporal bones, infrared nystagmography with positional and positioning testing, caloric testing, rotary chair and vibration testing. Clinical history and nystagmus varied among the five patients in this series. All patients were initially presumed to have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, but repositioning treatments were not effective, prompting referral, further testing and evaluation. In three patients with longstanding vestibular complaints, positional nystagmus was consistently present. One patient had distinct recurrent severe episodes of positional nystagmus. Nystagmus was unidirectional and horizontal. In one case horizontal nystagmus was consistently reproducible with seated head turn to the affected side, and reached 48 d/s. Nystagmus associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is often positional, and can be confused with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Unexplained vestibular symptoms in patients with unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss should prompt diagnostic consideration of EVA. </td>

(5) The elderly always accompanied with other medical condition and had risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. The efficacy was not associated with the complication(P>0.05). However, it was most likely to overtreatment caused by emphasizing other medical conditions treatment. BPPV was easy to ignore and misdiagnose, meanwhile, delayed the diagnosis and increased the medical costs. (6) Many elderly were accompanied cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylosis body stiffness and fear of vertigo which increased the difficulty of repositioning treatment.

The results of oVEMP were abnormal in 79. 7% (59/74) of the cases; and the results of cVEMP were abnormal in 66. 2% (49/74) of the cases; oVEMP and cVEMP differences to the diagnosis of primary BPPV (P<0. 05); oVEMP and cVEMP differences to the diagnosis primary BPPV with hearing lost (P<0. 05). oVEMP detection positive rate of primary BPPV is higher than cVEMP,which may be due to otolithic particles falling from the utricle; positive rate of cVEMP in primary BPPV with hearing loss is higher than that of oVEMP, which may related to the cochlear and sacculus occured in the same embryonic tissue structure.</td>

	<td>Measure the space direction of semicircular canals to provide the anatomical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV. We calculated angles among semicircular canals of 24 patients using MRI scaning with 3D-CISS sequence. The angle between the left and right posterior semicircular canals was 106.61 degress ± 8.58 degrees, so the angle among the posterior semicircular canals and sagittal head plane was 53.31 degrees ± 4.29 degrees. Pairs of contralateral synergistic canal planes were not parallel, forming 171.67 degrees ± 4.36 degrees between the left and right horizontal semicircular canal planes, 154.37 degrees ± 10.87 degrees between the left posterior and right anterior semicircular canal planes and 156.84 degrees ± 9.34 degrees between the right posterior and left anterior semicircular canal planes. Our measurement of the angles among semicircular canals coincided with those of previous reports. The angles between contralateral synergistic canal planes were close to parallel, but the angle between the posterior semicircular canals and sagittal head plane was great than 45 degrees that traditionally thought to be.</td>

Patients were investigated in terms of age, gender, symptoms, affected side, type of BPPV and the cure rate. Data were compared in patients with and without migraine. Mean values and standard deviations (± SD) were calculated. One way ANOVA test was used for the analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.005. 32 patients had migraine (11.4%). Gender ratio difference between groups was significant (4.2 vs. 1.3). Comparative analysis of average age between groups was not significant (p = 0.069; 38.50 ± 11.52, 43.38 ± 13.83). Majority of patients had symptoms less than 2 months and the difference was not significant (78.1% vs. 76%). Comparative analysis of cure rate of the therapeutic maneuvers between 2 groups was not significant (77% vs. 84%). Patients with BPPV may have associated migraine. However, this study does not indicate that the presence of migraine is a risk factor for BPPV for the cure since the therapeutic outcome is similar.</td>

Case series with chart review. Head-bending, lying-down positioning and the head-roll maneuver (HRM) under VNG guidance. The data were collected in a referral community hospital. Seventy-eight patients (32 apogeotropic and 46 geotropic nystagmus) with LC-BPPV who had been recruited between 2009 and 2013 were enrolled in the study. Patients were tested with the HRM and then were asked about subjectively worse side. Later, they were subjected to HBT when sitting and the LDPT. The results were compared and studied with the 1-way ANOVA and chi-square tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Affected side was identified by HRM in 75% of patients with apogeotropic nystagmus and 95.6% of patients with geotropic nystagmus. Approximately 65.6% of patients with apogeotropic and 52% of patients with geotropic nystagmus had nystagmus during LDPT. However, its comparability with HRM was low. However, treatment plan based on LDPT results alone provided relief of symptoms in additional 12.5% of patients with apogeotropic and in 2.2% of patients with geotropic nystagmus. Approximately 63% of patients with apogeotropic and 56% of patients with geotropic nystagmus were able to tell the worse side. Nystagmus comparable with HRM during HBT was low and not diagnostic. HRM has the greatest diagnostic value of positioning tests in LC-BPPV in this study. LDPT provides some contribution in the diagnosis of LC-BPPV but much less than HRM. Patients' subjective feeling of vertigo was also a useful test. However, HBT was not as sensitive as other measures in uncertain cases.</td>

The aim of this study was to document the demographic data of patients with BPPV regarding distribution of gender, age, associated problems, most common form, symptom duration, severity of nystagmus and cure rate. A total of 263 patients with video-nystagmography confirmed BPPV were enrolled in this retrospective study (2009-2013). The data were collected in Anadolu Medical Center. Distribution of gender, age and affected side were reviewed. Associated problems were noted. Patients were analyzed according to the canal involvement, age, duration of symptoms, duration of nystagmus and recurrence. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated. One-way ANOVA test was used for the analysis of the data (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 17.0 version, IBM, Chicago, III, USA). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Women were affected more frequently than men (1:1.5). Comparative analysis of average age between the two gender groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.84). BPPV was common at middle age group. The incidence of affected side was not significant (P = 0.74). Posterior canal-BPPV (PC-BPPV) was the most leading one (129/263; 49%) followed by lateral canal (LC)-canalolithiasis (60/263; 22.8%), LC-cupulolithiasis (38/263; 14.5%) and superior canal-BPPV (9/263; 3.4%). 55.1% of patients were defined as idiopathic (145/263). Associated problems were migraine (31/263; 11.8%), trauma (19/263; 7.2%), inner ear disorders (18/263; 6.8%) and other systemic problems (50/263; 19.1%). 72.6% of patients had symptoms <2 months (191/263). 23,6% of patients had intensive nystagmus lasting more than a minute regardless of canal involvement (62/263). 33% of patients required two or more maneuvers for the relief of symptoms (87/263). Symptoms are prone to recur in those of traumatic origin, associated inner ear problems and systemic disorders. As the prognostic factors are illuminated, preventive measures will be more effective and more patients will be cured properly.</td>

	<td>To confirm the possible relationships between serum level of uric acid (UA) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A total of 87 patients with BPPV and 36 age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited from our hospital between July 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014. All patients underwent a complete audio-vestibular test battery, such as Dix-Hallpike maneuver for posterior semicircular canal and supine roll test for horizontal semicircular canal. All risk factors such as the histories of heart and cerebral vascular diseases, and routine hematological and biochemical analyses were analyzed between two groups. No significant inter-group differences existed in age, gender, histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, smoking or drinking (P > 0.05). No significant differences existed between systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, whole blood count, lipid profile, homocysteine, prealbumin and blood urea nitrogen in patients with BPPV compared with controls (P >0. 05). However, the values of UA (267 ± 86 vs 325 ± 75) µmol/L, hemoglobin ale (5.6 ± 1. 4 vs 6.5 ± 1. 0)%, albumin (36 ± 4 vs 40 ± 4) g/L and creatinine (72 ± 20 vs 81 ± 22) µmol/L were much lower in patients with BPPV versus controls (P < 0. 05). According to multiple Logistic regression model, the lower levels of hemoglobin ale and albumin were independently associated with BPPV (P <0. 05) with the odds ratio of 1. 473 (95% CI 1. 066 - 2. 037) and 1. 162 (95% CI 1. 025 - 1. 318), respectively. However, the level of UA was not independently correlated with the occurrence of BPPV [OR = 1. 005 (95% CI 1. 000 - 1. 011), P =0. 063]. The lower levels of hemoglobin alc and albumin are independently associated with BPPV. Although the value of UA is lower in patients with BPPV versus controls, it is not an independent risk factor for BPPV. Due to limited patient data, further studies are needed to clarify the association in a larger sample size of different ethnic groups or longer follow ups.</td>

	<td>Numerous studies have been published on comorbid anxiety and depression in patients with vertigo. However, very few studies have separately described and analyzed anxiety or depression in patients with different types of vestibular peripheral vertigo. The present study investigated anxiety and depression among patients with 4 different types of peripheral vertigo. A total of 129 patients with 4 types of peripheral vertigo, namely, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV, n = 49), migrainous vertigo (MV, n = 37), Menière disease (MD, n = 28), and vestibular neuritis (VN, n = 15), were included in the present study. Otological and neurootological examinations were carefully performed, and self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale were used to evaluate anxiety and depression. Patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the vestibular function: normal and abnormal vestibular function. There was no significant difference in the risk of anxiety/depression between these 2 groups. However, for patients with the 4 different vertigo types, the prevalence of anxiety (MV = 45.9%, MD = 50%) and depression (MV = 27%, MD = 28.6%) was significantly higher in the patients with MV or MD than those with BPPV or VN (P < 0.05). Vestibular function is not significantly associated with the risk of anxiety/depression. Anxiety/depression is more common in patients with MV or MD than those with BPPV or VN. This may be due to the different mechanisms involved in these 4 types of vertigo, as well as differences in the prevention and self-control of the patients against the vertigo.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a relatively common complaint which occurs more often with increasing age. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an important cause which can easily be treated but is frequently not recognized by professionals. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of unrecognized BPPV in older patients. Patients ≥70 years of age (n = 989) indicated whether they experienced dizziness, and if so whether the symptoms were typical for BPPV. If affirmed, a diagnostic maneuver was performed. Positive patients were treated at once. All suspected patients completed quality of life questionnaires and were followed for 3 and 6 months. Positive BPPV patients were compared with negative (but suspected) patients. Almost one quarter of the patients (226 patients, 23 %) suffered from dizziness, among whom 101 were suspected of BPPV. Less than half (n = 45) underwent the diagnostic maneuver, of whom 13 (29 %) were positive for BPPV. At follow-up, one patient developed BPPV, leading to a total of 14 positive patients (overall prevalence 1.4 %). BPPV positive patients did not differ from BPPV negative patients. Among a large group of older patients, one quarter experiences dizziness, and 1.4 % has definite BPPV.</td>

The quick repositioning maneuver was to roll the patient from involved side to healthy side in the coronal plane for 180° as quickly as possible. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to different ages: young group (< 45 years), middle-age group (45 ≤ age < 60 years) and old group (≥ 60 years). The short and long term outcomes of the three groups were observed. The left ear was involved in 58 cases (51.3%) and the right ear in 55 cases (48.7%). The short term improvement rates of the young, middle-age and the old groups were 92.5%, 93.6% and 92.3% respectively, and the long term improvement rate was 90.0%, 85.1% and 73.1% respectively. There was no significant difference among the three groups in short and long term outcomes (P > 0.05). The recurrence rate of the three groups was 5.0%, 6.4% and 15.4% respectively, also no significant difference (P > 0.05). The quick repositioning maneuver along the coronal plane for PC-BPPV has a definite effect for every age groups. The method is simple, rapid and easy to master, and the patients are tolerated the maneuver well without evident side effect.</td>

Dynamic balance during standing was measured in Sensory Organization Test (SOT). Static balance during standing was measured in modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (mCTSIB). Data of BPPV patients were compared to that from 44 normal controls. Scores of the patients with PC BPPV were lower than that of the normal controls in the last three test conditions of SOT. Patients with PC BPPV demonstrated greater sway velocity in stance on foam with eyes open and eyes closed in mCTSIB. No postural deficit was observed in neither SOT nor mCTSIB when the patients with HC BPPV were compared to the normal controls. Disorders of the horizontal semicircular canal do not influence postural control. Both dynamic and static posturography can detect the postural imbalance caused by posterior semicircular canal dysfunction.</td>

	<td>Some studies have suggested that semicircular canal occlusion is effective and safe for treating intractable posterior semicircular benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PSC-BPPV), and adverse effects of canal occlusions for intractable horizontal semicircular BPPV (HSC-BPPV) were rarely reported. The aim of this study was to retrospectively discuss the efficacy of semicircular canal occlusion for intractable HSC-BPPV with at least 2 years of follow-up. From 2000 to 2011, 3 female patients (average age=60±6.9 years), with a diagnosis of HSC-BPPV refractory to head-shake and barbecue roll maneuver, underwent semicircular canal occlusion treatment in our hospital. The supine roll test was performed to diagnose HSC-BPPV and evaluate the treatment efficacy. All patients with intractable HSC-BPPV had complete resolution of their positional vertigo after semicircular canal occlusion with a negative supine roll test. All patients reported transient postoperative disequilibrium, nausea, and vomiting, which resolved within 2 weeks. In addition, 1 patient (33.3%) had transient tinnitus, which resolved after 4 months. There were no other significant long-term complications. Semicircular canal occlusion appears to be a safe and well-tolerated treatment modality for intractable HSC-BPPV. However, further studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm our conclusion.</td>

	<td>Having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) puts patients at a significantly higher risk of falling. It is poorly recognised and diagnosis is frequently delayed. BPPV has been studied in outpatient settings, but there have been no studies looking at the prevalence in patients admitted with falls. This study aims to establish how common BPPV is in these patients.For a 4-month period, patients admitted on an unselected medical take were screened for an admission precipitated by a fall. Patients who consented were assessed for BPPV using the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. Patients who tested positive were treated using the Epley manoeuvre. The assessments were carried out by specialist physiotherapists who were experienced at assessing and diagnosing patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. Out of the 111 patients initially identified, 37 (33%) were considered to be appropriate and consented to be part of the study. Of these, 20 patients (54%) had a positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre.Of the patients included in the study, over half tested positive for BPPV. This merits further study. Potentially, there is a proportion of patients admitted with falls who have an easily treatable contributing factor that is not being identified with standard practice. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an unfamiliar and rare complication occurring following osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE) and simultaneous implant placement. Etiology of this disorder is commonly displacement of otoliths by vibratory forces transmitted by osteotomes and mallet along with the hyperextension of the head during the operation, causing them to float around in the endolymph. This report presents a case of protracted BPPV following OSFE and simultaneous implant placement. A 43-year-old female suffered intense vertigo and nausea immediately after implant placement using an OSFE procedure. Upon further questioning after the procedure she gave an account of two times vertigo history within the last 9 years. Despite nootropic drug medication and canalith repositioning procedure applied by a specialist at operation night, the condition did not improve. Patient did not totally recover and was admitted again after 1 month. After repeated maneuvers, nine dosage intravenous serous fluid and piracetam administration the patient recovered. Duration of these procedures took 10 days and the patient was successfully treated with no recurrence of dizziness. Prevention and management of OSFE related BPPV are reviewed especially in patients having prior vertigo history in this report. </td>

	<td>Anterior semicircular canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (antBPPV) is the rarest form of semicircular canalolithiasis, corresponding to about 1-2 % of the BPPV. The diagnosis is obtained by either the Dix-Hallpike maneuver or the straight head hanging positioning maneuver, which provoke a characteristic positional down-beating nystagmus. This vertical nystagmus can be associated with a torsional component that helps in localizing the affected side. The differential diagnosis of antBPPV includes the various central lesions that produce vertical down beating nystagmus (posterior fossa). Several liberatory maneuvers have been proposed for the treatment of antBPPV, but still need standardization.</td>

	<td>Endolymphatic sac decompression (ESD) for the treatment of Ménière's disease (MD) has had limited success and variable results in the literature. We have devised a novel technique that involves blocking the endolymphatic duct with surgical clips. In a separate effort to study the endolymphatic sac (ELS), we have sectioned the lateral part of the main body of the ELS as biopsies from a subset of patients. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the lateral part sectioning of the ELS on short-term surgical outcomes. This was a single-physician, retrospective study in a tertiary medical center. MD patients underwent endolymphatic duct blockage (EDB) surgery with or without ELS biopsy. The assessed surgical outcomes were the occurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), intraoperative CSF leaks, aural fullness, tinnitus, vertigo spells, and pure tone audiometry. Data were collected at the following visits: preoperatively 1st week, 1st month, and 6th months. A total of 63 patients were included. The outcomes of the biopsy group (EDB+B) (n=27) were compared to those of the EDB group (n=36) at each visit. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative BPPV, CSF leaks, aural fullness, tinnitus, or vertigo spells. The SDS, the PTA, and bone conduction were not significantly different at any visit, and PTA variations were similar in both groups. Our results suggest that aggressive decompression of the ELS by sectioning the sac does not benefit patients in the early postoperative period. The short-term success of EDB surgery is attributable to the effective obstruction of the endolymphatic duct regardless of pressure in the ELS.</td>

	<td>Clinicians sometimes treat patients with relatively long-duration geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN), without latency. Recently, the concept of a "light cupula" in the lateral canal that reveals persistent geotropic DCPN has been introduced. In the present study, we investigated the immediate and short-term therapeutic findings in long-duration DCPN. The authors prospectively compared the therapeutic efficacy of a canalith-repositioning procedure (CRP) in short- and long-duration geotropic DCPN. In patients with long-duration DCPN, the authors found no immediate therapeutic effect, and the number of patients showing short-term effects (on the next day) was very low compared with the comparable figure among those with short-duration DCPN. In addition, no cases exhibited canal conversion after the CRP. Our results suggest that CRP is not useful in patients with long-duration geotropic DCPN, and the pathogenesis of long-duration geotropic DCPN may not originate from free-floating debris but from deflection of the cupula.</td>

	<td>Repair of superior canal dehiscence (SCD) often results in the resolution of preoperative auditory and vestibular symptoms; however, many patients experience dizziness in the postoperative period. Postoperative dizziness may be the result of new-onset benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This study aims to investigate the prevalence of BPPV before and following SCD repair. Retrospective chart review at a tertiary care center. Electronic medical records were reviewed for patients with a diagnosis of SCD syndrome (SCDS) between January 2002 and May 2015. Collected information included demographic data, incidence of BPPV diagnosed by Dix-Hallpike maneuver before and following surgery, operative technique, repair material, and the duration of time to BPPV onset. A total of 180 patients with a diagnosis of SCDS were identified: 84 patients underwent surgery (operated subjects) and 96 were observed (nonoperated, control group). In operated subjects, 20 of 84 (23.8%) developed BPPV following SCD repair versus 6.2% of nonoperated (P < 0.005). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo lateralized to the operated side in all but one subject whose laterality was unknown (P < 0.0001). There were no associations of BPPV with surgical approach (P = 0.50) or repair material (P = 0.33). The majority of subjects (58%) were diagnosed with BPPV within 3 months of surgery. New-onset BPPV occurs commonly after SCD repair and may be the result of mobilized otoliths from inner ear pressure changes. Although the exact etiology of post-SCD repair BPPV remains unknown, postoperative dizziness is important to discuss with patients during preoperative counseling. 4.

	<td>History taking is an essential part in the diagnostic process of vestibular disorders. The approach to focus strongly on the quality of symptoms, like vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness, is not that useful as these symptoms often coexist and are all nonspecific, as each of them may arise from vestibular and nonvestibular diseases (like cardiovascular disease) and do not permit to distinguish potentially dangerous from benign causes. Instead, patients should be categorized if they have an acute, episodic, or chronic vestibular syndrome (AVS, EVS, or CVS) to narrow down the spectrum of differential diagnosis. Typical examples of disorders provoking an AVS would be vestibular neuritis or stroke of peripheral or central vestibular structures, of an EVS Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or vestibular migraine and of a CVS long-standing uni- or bilateral vestibular failure or cerebellar degeneration. The presence of triggers should be established with a main distinction between positional (change of head orientation with respect to gravity), head motion-induced (time-locked to head motion regardless of direction) and orthostatic position change as the underlying disorders are quite different. Accompanying symptoms also help to orient to the underlying cause, like aural or neurologic symptoms, but also chest pain or dyspnea. </td>

Prospective, controlled study. Thirty-three children aged 7 to 18 years with (n = 21) and without (n = 12) dizziness underwent static SVV. History, exam, rotary chair, and caloric testing were used to categorize subjects with dizziness into groups with peripheral vestibular loss (PVL), benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV), central vertigo (CV), and nonvestibular dizziness (NVD). Mean SVV deviation was significantly higher in the peripheral vestibular loss group (n = 4; 2.1 ± 1.5) compared to BPPV (n = 5; 0.5 ± 0.3), CV (n = 7; 0.4 ± 0.3), NVD (n = 5; 0.6 ± 0.4), and control (n = 12; 0.7 ± 0.5) groups by one-way analysis of variance (P = .002). SVV deviation >2° demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 97% for PVL. SVV is a simple, noninvasive test that provides a valuable contribution to the assessment of peripheral vestibular function in children. 3b Laryngoscope, 126:727-731, 2016.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common type of vertigo in the general population, is thought to be caused by dislodgement of otoliths from otolithic organs into the semicircular canals. In most cases, however, the cause behind the otolith dislodgement is unknown. Dental procedures, one of the most common medical treatments, are considered to be a possible cause of BPPV, although this has yet to be proven. This study is the first nationwide population-based case-control study conducted to investigate the correlation between BPPV and dental manipulation. Patients diagnosed with BPPV between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012 were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We further identified those who had undergone dental procedures within 1 month and within 3 months before the first diagnosis date of BPPV. We also identified the comorbidities of the patients with BPPV, including head trauma, osteoporosis, migraine, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and stroke. These variables were then compared to those in age- and gender-matched controls. In total, 768 patients with BPPV and 1536 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. In the BPPV group, 9.2% of the patients had undergone dental procedures within 1 month before the diagnosis of BPPV. In contrast, only 5.5% of the controls had undergone dental treatment within 1 month before the date at which they were identified (P = 0.001). After adjustments for demographic factors and comorbidities, recent exposure to dental procedures was positively associated with BPPV (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.47). This association was still significant if we expanded the time period from 1 month to 3 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval 1.39-2.26). Our results demonstrated a correlation between dental procedures and BPPV. The specialists who treat patients with BPPV should consider dental procedures to be a risk factor, and dentists should recognize BPPV as a possible complication of dental treatment.</td>

We conducted a retrospective study of 15,470 participants (7735 anxiety disorder patients and 7735 control patients) selected from the NHIRD. Patients were observed for a maximum of 9 years to determine the rates of newly diagnosed BPPV. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the risk of BPPV among the patients with anxiety disorders. During the 9-year follow-up period, 178 (2.05 per 1000 person-years) anxiety disorder patients and 71 (0.81 per 1000 person-years) control patients were diagnosed with BPPV. The incidence risk ratio of BPPV between anxiety disorder patients and control patients was 2.52 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.90-3.37, P < .001). After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, patients with anxiety disorders were found to be 2.17 times more likely to develop BPPV (95 % CI, 1.63-2.90, P < .001) than the control patients. Furthermore, female sex (HR = 1.81, 95 % CI, 1.31-2.50, P < .001) and cerebrovascular disease (HR = 1.53, 95 % CI, 1.00-2.34, P = .050) were independent risk factors for developing new-onset BPPV in patients with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorder patients may have an increased risk of developing BPPV, especially those who are female or have cerebrovascular disease.</td>

Objective BPPV was subsequently determined by positional evoking maneuvers under the record of optical Frenzel glasses. Cronbach's coefficient α was used to evaluate the reliability of psychometric scales. The validity of DHI total, 5-item and 2-item questionnaires to screen for BPPV was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. It revealed that the DHI 5-item questionnaire had good internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient α = 0.72). Area under the curve of total DHI, 5-item and 2-item scores for discriminating BPPV from those without was 0.678 (95 % CI 0.578-0.778), 0.873(95 % CI 0.807-0.940) and 0.895(95 % CI 0.836-0.953), respectively. It revealed 74.5 % sensitivity and 88.7 % specificity in separating BPPV and those without, with a cutoff value of 12 in the 5-item questionnaire. The corresponding rate of sensitivity and specificity was 78.2 and 88.7 %, respectively, with a cutoff value of 6 in 2-item questionnaire. The present study indicated that both 5-item and 2-item questionnaires in the Chinese version of DHI may be more valid than DHI total score for screening objective BPPV and merit further application in clinical practice in China. </td>

	<td>The aim of this study is to explore the misdiagnosis status of the otolaryngology in China as well as to provide evidence to reduce misdiagnosis and improve the diagnostic level. The retrieval and management system of the misdiagnosed diseases database developed by Chen Xiaohong was used for searching the literature of the misdiagnosis in otolaryngology.The 10 year' smisdiagnosis literature data of the otolaryngology(from 2004 to 2013) were analyzed including the literature sources, sample size, misdiagnosis rate,misdiagnosis consequences and misdiagnosis reasons. A total of 369 articles were found,including 4211 cases.The average misdiagnosis rate was 25.43% in 51 diagnosed diseases.The top misdiagnosed diseases were nasopharyngeal tuberculosis(84.76%),tuberculous otitis media (75%) and congenital laryngeal cyst(75%).The lowest misdiagnosed disease was nasosinusitis(5.92%).The top three misdiagnosed diseases were tuberculosis of otolaryngology(1216 cases),nasosinusitis(710 cases) and BPPV(697 cases).After statistical analysis,we found that 97.22% of the misdiagnosed patients were grade Ⅲ consequences (that is the misdiagnosis and mistreatment does not cause adverse consequences),but there were still 10 cases caused gradeⅠconsequences(death or sequela).The main causes of the misdiagnosis were lack of diagnosis experience, non detailed interrogation and physical examination and non targeted examinations. The big data of the 10 years reflects the misdiagnosis phenomenon in otolaryngology to some extent.Neurologist, stomatologist and ophthalmologist should be familiar to the main points of the differential diagnosis diseases of the otolaryngology and strive to reduce the clinical misdiagnosis and mistreatment.</td>

	<td>The sudden development of vertigo or dizziness without focal neurological symptoms is generally attributable to vestibular diseases such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Isolated vertigo or dizziness attack needs more attention than vestibular diseases. This retrospective study was performed to elucidate the frequency of strokes in patients with isolated vertigo or dizziness attack. We enrolled 221 patients (men, 119; women, 102; mean age, 68.4 ± 10.3 years) who were admitted to our hospital over the last 10 years because of sudden isolated vertigo or dizziness attack without other neurological symptoms except for nystagmus, deafness, or tinnitus. We investigated the clinical features, final diagnosis, neuroimaging findings, and short- or long-term outcome of these patients. One hundred eighteen patients had vertigo whereas the other 103 had dizziness. Brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed recent stroke lesions in 25 patients (11.3%) (ischemic, 21; hemorrhagic, 4).The lesions were generally small and localized in the cerebellum (n = 21), pons (n = 1), medulla oblongata (n = 1), or corona radiata (n = 1). Of the 25 patients, 19 (76%) had dizzy-type spells; none had neurological dysfunction at the time of discharge. In the remaining 196 patients, no stroke was detected on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Stroke was found in 11% of patients with isolated vertigo or dizziness attack. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery area was the most frequently implicated for isolated vertigo or dizziness.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common and very distressing presentation in general practice. In more than half of these cases, the dizziness is due to vertigo, which is the illusion of movement of the body or its surroundings. It can have central or peripheral causes, and determining the cause can be difficult. The aim of this article is to provide a clear framework for approaching patients who present with vertigo. A suggested approach to the assessment of vertigo is outlined. The causes of vertigo may be central (involving the brainstem or cerebellum) or peripheral (involving the inner ear). A careful history and physical examination can distinguish between these causes. The most common causes of vertigo seen in primary care are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuronitis (VN) and Ménière's disease. These peripheral causes of vertigo are benign, and treatment involves reassurance and management of symptoms.</td>

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the relationship between DM and BPPV in the presence of known contributors like age, gender and hypertension. A retrospective review of the records of 3933 individuals was categorized by the specific vestibular diagnosis and for the presence of type 2 DM and hypertension. As the prevalence of BPPV was higher in people with type 2 DM compared to those without DM, multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify variables predictive of BPPV. The relationship between type 2 DM, hypertension and BPPV was analyzed using mediation analysis. BPPV was seen in 46% of individuals with type 2 DM, compared to 37% of individuals without DM (p< 0.001). Forty two percent of the association between type 2 DM and BPPV was mediated by hypertension, and supported hypertension as a complete mediator in the relationship between type 2 DM and BPPV. Hypertension may provide the mediating pathway by which diabetes affects the vestibular system. Individuals with complaints of dizziness, with comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes, may benefit from a screening for BPPV.</td>

	<td>Emergency department (ED) patients who present with acute dizziness or vertigo can be challenging to diagnose. Roughly half have general medical disorders that are usually apparent from the context, associated symptoms, or initial laboratory tests. The rest include a mix of common inner ear disorders and uncommon neurologic ones, particularly vertebrobasilar strokes or posterior fossa mass lesions. In these latter cases, misdiagnosis can lead to serious adverse consequences for patients. Our aim was to assist emergency physicians to use the physical examination effectively to make a specific diagnosis in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo. Recent evidence indicates that the physical examination can help physicians accurately discriminate between benign inner ear conditions and dangerous central ones, enabling correct management of peripheral vestibular disease and avoiding dangerous misdiagnoses of central ones. Patients with the acute vestibular syndrome mostly have vestibular neuritis, but some have stroke. Data suggest that focused eye movement examinations, at least when performed by specialists, are more sensitive for detecting early stroke than brain imaging, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with the triggered episodic vestibular syndrome mostly have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), but some have posterior fossa mass lesions. Specific positional tests to provoke nystagmus can confirm a BPPV diagnosis at the bedside, enabling immediate curative therapy, or indicate the need for imaging. Emergency physicians can effectively use the physical examination to make a specific diagnosis in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo. They must understand the limitations of brain imaging. This may reduce misdiagnosis of serious central causes of dizziness, including posterior circulation stroke and posterior fossa mass lesions, and improve resource utilization.</td>

	<td>There are no epidemiological studies quantifying the prevalence of second causes of dizziness in Ménière's disease (MD). Therefore, we aimed to quantify which dizziness-inducing causes are prevalent alongside MD. Moreover, we analyzed which second cause of dizziness was more common in a specific age group and if age was a risk factor. Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary referral center. Data were retrospectively obtained from all MD patients who visited our clinic between January 2000 and December 2013. Workup included vestibular tests, pure tone audiometry, blood pressure monitoring, and the hyperventilation provocation test, the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The final causes of dizziness were based on consensus between an ENT-surgeon and a neurologist who were consulted simultaneously. We found that 143 (30%) of 469 MD patients suffered from a second cause of dizziness. The two most common causes were psychological distress (PD) (70%) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (18%). The mean age for MD patients with PD was 58.7 ± 13.3 years compared with the mean age of 63.9 ± 14.3 years for MD patients without PD (mean difference = -5.2 years, 95% CI: -8.3 to -2.2, p = 0.001). MD patients younger than 60 of age had a 15% higher risk of suffering from psychological distress than those who were older than 60 (risk difference, 15%, 95% CI, 7.0-22%). Age could not be identified as a risk factor for BPPV in older MD patients. In 30% of the patients with MD a second cause of dizziness is present. PD most commonly coincides with MD, especially in younger patients. The second most common cause is BPPV.</td>

	<td>Residual dizziness (RD) following the resolution of a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BBPV) episode is frequently reported by patients. Possible causes are still under debate in the literature. This study discusses the possible role of otolithic function and of elapsed time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis in the genesis of RD. In total, 116 patients younger than 65 years with their first episode of BPPV and without any other comorbidities were enrolled in the study. Before a bedside examination, subjective visual vertical (SVV) was determined in the case of a history suggestive of BPPV. SVV was tested 1 week later in those patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal, and in whom positioning maneuvers showed resolution of BPPV. At 1 week control, reported RD and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) were recorded. Diagnosis and treatment of BPPV occurred within 4 days in 43 patients (group A), between 5 and 8 days in 38 patients (group B) and in more than 9 days in 35 patients (group C). Higher values of reported RD and DHI were recorded in group C, while higher values of SVV deviation were recorded in group A with an inverse relationship between SVV and DHI. Initial peripheral vestibular function asymmetry due to BPPV can induce a new central adaptation. This adaptation becomes better established the longer otoconia remain floating in the endolymph. Because of these changes, the brain is unable to quickly readapt to the old pattern after resolution resulting in more persistent RD. </td>

Total antioxidant status as well as paraoxonase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-1β levels were evaluated in peripheral venous serum samples of 30 BPPV and 30 control patients. Total antioxidant status levels were lower in the BPPV group than in the control group (p=0.008). After Epley's repositioning maneuver in the vertigo group, there was a statistically significant decline in IL-1β levels at the first and third month visits (p=0.014 for first month and p=0.013 for third month).

	<td>and objectives: In-depth assessment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex with the new video systems available provides information on various previously-unidentified characteristics in patients with peripheral vestibular disorder. The aim of this work is to quantify how often pathological gain (uni- or bilateral) in the posterior semicircular canal (PSC) gain appears in video head-impulse testing (vHIT) with preservation of the gain in the rest of the semicircular canals, and to analyse the relation of this frequency with patient age and/or diagnosis. This was a prospective observational study on adults referred to our unit between June 2012 and February 2014. Age, sex, pathological antecedents, prior history of vestibular pathology, diagnosis and time of evolution of the clinical picture and its characteristics were recorded. Each patient underwent a complete otoneurological examination, including vHIT (Otometrics®). Depending on suspected diagnosis, patients also received cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing, tonal audiometry and speech test, as well as assessment by Neurology and/or nuclear magnetic resonance or computed axial tomography scan imaging study. In all, 363 patients were assessed; 57 (16%) patients (33 males and 24 females; mean age, 57 ± 15 years) showed pathological PSC gains, 46 (81%) unilateral and 11 (19%) bilateral. Ménière's Disease was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (27%). Patients with unilateral involvement were younger than those with bilateral (55 vs. 68 years; p=0.03). In the patients with bilateral involvement, PSC gain and age were related (-0.7; 0.04) and the gain value was symmetrical in both ears (0.7; p=0.05). The gain in the anterior and horizontal canals tended to decrease with age, but without statistical significance in our sample. Of the patients referred for an otoneurological consultation, 16% showed pathological PSC gain (unilateral in 81% and bilateral in 19% of the cases). This gain involvement was attributable to age when the gain was bilateral and symmetrical.</td>

	<td>To compare the clinical features and outcomes between patients with multi-canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(BPPV) and single-canal BPPV. Five-hundred and seventy-eight patients with BPPV were retrospectively analyzed and divided into three groups: single-canal BPPV(526 cases),multi-canal BPPV in unilateral ear(11 cases) and multi-canal BPPV in both ears(41 cases).All patients were diagnosed by using the Dix-Hallpike test or roll test and treated with the canalith repositioning procedure.The following factors,including aetiology,age,sex,response to treatment and recurrence,were compared among the three groups. ①Greater percentage of idiopathic cases were identified in single-canal(66.2%:48.2%, <0.01).Traumatic origin and prior history of BPPV were more common in bilateral multi-canal(41.6%:9.2%, <0.05)and unilateral multi-canal (36.2%:0, <0.01)respectively.②The recurrence rate was higher in multi-canal BPPV(40.4%:14.3%, <0.01). Idiopathic BPPV is more common in single-canal BPPV.Potential causes may be identified in multi-canal BPPV.However,over 90% of the patients with single-canal and multi-canal BPPV are cured.</td>

	<td>To compare the therapeutic efficacy and the recurrence rate between the simple repositioning method and the reposition manoeuvre plus medication in the treatment of horizontal semicircular canal otolith benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HSC-BPPV).  Sixty-two patients diagnosed with otolith HSC-BPPV by roll maneuver test were randomly divided into canalith repositioning group (32 patients) and reposition plus drug treatment group (30 patients). Patients in the canalith repositioning group were treated only with Barbecue reposition maneuver; patients in the reposition plus drug treatment group were treated firstly with Barbecue reposition maneuver and then were given Alprostadil, Cinepazide and Betahistine drug treatment. Both groups were evaluated after 7 days and 28 days treatment, and the recurrence rate was analyzed after 3 months.  After 7 days of the treatment , the recovery rate of the two groups was 62.5% and 73.3%, respectively. There's no significant difference between the two groups. However, the total effective power of the reposition plus drug treatment group was 96.7%, which was significantly higher than that of the canalith repositioning group (75.0%) (χ²=5.858,  <0.05). There were 8 patients in the canalith repositioning group showed changes of BBPV types after treatment, while only 1 patient in the reposition plus drug treatment group showed lesion changes. The difference was statistically significant (χ²=4.061,  <0.05). After 28 days of the treatment, the recovery rate and the total effective power of the two groups was 100%, respectively. There is no statistical difference in the total effective rate between the two groups. After 3 months follow-up, 2 patients in the canalith repositioning group (6.25%) and in the reposition plus drug treatment group (6.67%) showed BBPV recurrence, and no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the two groups ( >0.05).  The repositioning maneuver is the preferred method for treating HSC BPPV. Canalith reposition maneuver plus medication has no obvious effect on the recovery rate and the recurrence rate, it only increases the effective rate and reduces the changes of the BBPV types.</td>

	<td>Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) is characterized by complaints of dizziness, gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical man oeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in people with symptomatic UVPD. A systematic review was conducted for the population of adults diagnosed with symptomatic UPVD, living in the community. We searched all relevant databases and trials registers to identify randomized controlled trials comparing vestibular rehabilitation versus control (e.g. placebo), other treatment (non-vestibular rehabilitation, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of vestibular rehabilitation. We considered possible effectiveness in the domains of symptoms (dizziness) or function (activities, quality of life) and where possible combined results in meta-analyses to provide overall estimates of effect. We included 39 studies involving 2441 participants with UPVD in the review. Individual and pooled analyses of the primary outcome (frequency of dizziness) showed a statistically significant effect in favor of vestibular rehabilitation over control or no intervention (odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 3.86). Secondary outcomes measures related to levels of activity or participation showed a strong trend towards significant differences between the groups (standardized mean difference -0.83, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.64). However when movement-based vestibular rehabilitation was compared to physical maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49). There were no reported adverse effects and risk of bias was generally low across the studies. There is moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation is a safe, effective management for UPVD. For the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) maneuvers are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

	<td>The presence of utricular and saccular dysfunction impairs quality of life (QoL) in patients. The aims of the present study were to examine the effect of repositioning maneuvers on QoL of patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and to describe the effect of cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) or ocular VEMP (oVEMP) abnormalities on patient recovery after rehabilitation. Thirty idiopathic BPPV patients with/without otolith dysfunctions (n = 15, each group) were included in this clinical trial study. Otolith dysfunction was determined using oVEMP and cVEMP abnormalities. EcochG and caloric tests were performed to rule out other causes of secondary BPPV. The QoL in groups of patients with idiopathic BPPV was assessed using a Persian version of the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI-P) before and after treatment with Epley's maneuver. Pre-treatment results showed significant handicaps in both groups. DHI-P scores were higher in BPPV patients with otolith dysfunction (total, functional, emotional, physical score: 34.13, 11.20, 7.06, 15.86, respectively) than those in patients without otolith dysfunction (total, functional, emotional, physical score: 25.46, 7.86, 6.13, 11.46, respectively, P < 0.05). After treatment, DHI-P scores decreased in both groups. However, in the otolith dysfunction group, DHI-P scores (total, functional, emotional, physical score: 9.20, 3.33, 1.33, 4.53, respectively) were higher than those in patients without otolith dysfunction (total, functional, emotional, physical score: 4.13, 0.93, 1.06, 2.00, respectively). In BPPV patients with cVEMP or oVEMP abnormalities, QoL is more compromised in comparison with that in BPPV patients without these dysfunctions. Otolith dysfunction enhances the negative effects of BPPV on QoL.</td>

	<td>Conclusion This study investigated a novel instrument to diagnose benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Objective To develop a new scoring system of an interview for the diagnosis of BPPV. Methods The answers to questions on dizziness and/or vertigo (D/V) (571 patients) were analyzed and the questions for which the answers differed significantly between the patients with and without BPPV were selected. Results This study established an intensive questionnaire with a scoring system. It consists of the following questions: (1) Is rotary vertigo a characteristic of your D/V? (2) Is your D/V triggered when you roll your head over in a supine position? (3) Does your D/V disappear within 5 min? (4) Have you previously experienced hearing loss in one ear, or have you experienced hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness with this D/V? One point each was given to an answer of 'yes' to questions (1) and (2). Two points were given to an answer of 'yes' to question (3). One point was subtracted upon an answer of 'yes' to question (4). When the total score was greater than two points, the patient was diagnosed with BPPV. The sensitivity of the diagnosis of BPPV by this scoring system was 81% and the specificity was 69%. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder that causes vertigo. Study of BPPV has dramatically rapid progress in recent years. We analyze the BPPV growth We searched the international data quantity year by year in database of PubMed, ScienceDirect and WILEY before 2014 respectively, then we searched the domestic data quantity year by year in database of CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Data before 2015 by selecting "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo" as the keywords. Then we carried out regression analysis with the gathered results in above databases to determine data growth regularity and main factors that affect future development of BPPV. Also, we analyzes published BPPV papers in domestic and international journals. PubMed database contains 808 literatures, ScienceDirect contains 177 database and WILEY contains 46 literatures, All together we collected 1 038 international articles. CNKI contains 440 literatures, VIP contains 580 literatures and WanFang data contains 449 literatures. All together we collected 1 469 domestic literatures. It shows the rising trend of the literature accumulation amount of BPPV. The scattered point diagram of BPPV shows an exponential growing trend, which was growing slowly in the early time but rapidly in recent years. It shows that the development of BPPV has three stages from international arical: exploration period (before 1985), breakthrough period (1986-1998). The deepening stage (after 1998), Chinese literature also has three stages from domestic BPPV precess. Blank period (before the year of 1982), the enlightenment period (1982-2004), the deepening stage (after the year of 2004). In the pregress of BPPV, many outsantding sccholars played an important role in domestic scitifction of researching, which has produced a certain influence in the worldwide.</td>

	<td>Objective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (O-BPPV) and subjective BPPV (S-BPPV) have similar demographic and clinical features. Canalith repositioning manoeuvres (CRMs) can be an effective treatment for patients with S-BPPV, and a diagnosis of positional nystagmus is not essential for considering CRMs. This study supports the use of CRMs as the primary treatment for S-BPPV. To examine differences in demographic and clinical features, as well as treatment outcomes, between O-BPPV and S-BPPV. The medical records of 134 patients with BPPV were reviewed for demographic characteristics, past medical history, associated symptoms, response to CRMs, interval between symptom onset and the first medical visit, and recurrence rate. The O-BPPV group (n = 101) comprised patients who experienced vertigo and accompanying autonomic symptoms, and showed typical nystagmus. The S-BPPV group (n = 33) comprised patients who, when subjected to a provoking manoeuvre, showed all of the classic BPPV symptoms but did not show nystagmus. All patients had at least 3 years of follow-up. The demographics (age and sex ratio), past medical history, and associated symptoms were not significantly different between the two groups. Posterior semi-circular canal BPPV appeared more than twice as often as horizontal semi-circular canal BPPV in patients with S-BPPV. However, both canals were affected to a similar proportion in patients with O-BPPV, and the difference was marginally significant (p = 0.073). Overall improvement was better in O-BPPV than in S-BPPV; however, there was no significant difference. The total numbers of manoeuvres for recovery and the interval between symptom onset and the first medical visit also did not show any significant inter-group differences. During a 3-year follow-up, the recurrence rate was 13.8% for O-BPPV and 21.2% for S-BPPV.</td>

	<td>To evaluate changes in calcium metabolism in patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) on initial presentation and at the follow-up visit. The study comprised a total of 31 patients aged greater than 18 years who presented at the otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinic of our hospital, newly diagnosed as idiopathic BPPV based on the history compatible with BPPV and positive provocative maneuver (either Dix-Hallpike or Roll test). The first blood sample was obtained on the day of initial presentation when the patient was found to have active unilateral BPPV. After 6 months, a blood sample was again drawn in accordance with the procedure. Blood samples were analyzed for data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)-D), total calcium, parathormone and ionized calcium on initial presentation, and at the follow-up visit. The patients comprised 20 (64.5%) women and 11 (35.5%) men with a mean age of 49.78 years (range, 23-75 years). During an attack a higher prevalence of decreased serum Vitamin D is less than 20 ng/ml, was determined (93.5% versus 38.7%). There were statistical differences between the Vitamin D values, parathormone, and corrected by pH ionized calcium in both periods (p < 0.05). A statistically significant association was determined between Vitamin D and calcium metabolism in patients with idiopathic BPPV. It can be considered that Vitamin D deficiency and decreased ionized Ca level may be a risk for BPPV, not only in patients with osteoporosis but also in all patients. Very low levels of 25(OH)-D seem to be associated with recurrence of BPPV. The recurrences might possibly be prevented with supplementary Vitamin D especially in those with recurrent idiopathic BPPV but further studies would be necessary to determine this.</td>

	<td>Although there has been a wide consensus on the mechanism of nystagmus and clinical presentation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the neuroepithelial pathophysiology of BPPV still remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the pathophysiology of BPPV by evaluating the cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) findings of patients. Thirty-six BPPV patients and 20 healthy volunteers were included. Bilateral cVEMP tests were performed on all participants. The participants were divided into the following three groups: those with a BPPV-affected ear, those with a BPPV-unaffected ear, and the healthy control group. There were no significant differences regarding the latencies of the first positive (p1) and negative (n1) peaks among the three groups. The mean normalized amplitude asymmetry ratio also did not differ between the BPPV and control groups. However, the normalized amplitudes of the BPPV patients (with both affected and unaffected ears) were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group. We detected that the cVEMP data of the affected and unaffected ears of the BPPV patients was similar and that their normalized amplitudes significantly differed from those of the healthy controls. Eventually, we concluded that even if the symptoms of BPPV were unilateral, the findings suggest that the bilateral involvement of the macular neuroepithelium is important in understanding the pathophysiology of BPPV. This finding supports the conclusion that the pathophysiological process starts with neuroepithelial membrane degeneration and continues with otoconia separation.</td>

Plastic surgeons may be unfamiliar with certain complications after rhinoplasty operations. In this study, we aimed to present four unintentional complications that have occurred in our patients and review the literature related to these complications. In this study, we conducted a review of 1400 patients who were operated on from 2007 to 2015. The medical recordings of all patients were investigated. Four patients with unintentional complications after rhinoplasty operations are presented and the related literature was reviewed. Cases 1 and 2: These patients included a 26-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man who developed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections after a primary septorhinoplasty. Case 3: This was a 25-year-old woman who developed periorbital emphysema after a primary rhinoplasty operation. Case 4: This was a 22-year-old woman who developed a second-degree burn on the nasal dorsum. All patients healed without sequel or scars. Many unexpected complications have been reported in the literature. Some of these complications include bleeding disorders, allergic reactions, dermatitis, visual loss, gastric bleeding, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, false aneurysm after rhinoplasty, pneumocephalus, Tapia's syndrome, cavernous sinus syndrome, and skin reactions to prolene. Meticulous patient histories, consistent surgical routines, careful radiologic examinations, and frequent patient visits can help surgeons control these types of complications.

	<td>Nonpharmacological interventions have been shown to have some effectiveness in adults with dizziness; however, the effectiveness of these interventions in older people is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of conservative nonpharmacological interventions for dizziness in older people. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, AMED, Index to Chiropractic Literature, PsycINFO, and MANTIS were searched from inception to May 2014. Two investigators independently screened controlled trials with participants who were more than 60 years old and experienced dizziness. Studies of participants with dizziness from a specific diagnosis, such as Ménière disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, were excluded. Outcome measures from the selected studies included self-reported dizziness and postural balance. Two investigators independently extracted data on participants, interventions, comparison group, outcome measures, and results. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed with Cochrane guidelines. Seven articles consisting of 7 controlled trials were included. All studies involved some form of exercise, including vestibular rehabilitation exercises, postural balance exercises, and tai chi exercise, as the main intervention. The studies had a high risk of bias because of the lack of adequate randomization and allocation concealment, the lack of reporting on cointerventions, the lack of reporting on reasons for dropouts, and the lack of reporting on participant adherence. Heterogeneity among the included studies in interventions and outcome measures prohibited a meta-analysis. Only 2 studies reported a significant difference between the intervention group and the comparison group for self-reported dizziness. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments for dizziness in older people. Current evidence is hampered by a high risk of bias, and well-designed trials with adequate masking, randomization, and adherence are needed.</td>

	<td>Accurate lateralization is important to improve treatment outcomes in horizontal semicircular canal (HSCC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). To determine the involved side in HSCC-BPPV, the intensity of nystagmus has been compared in a head-roll test (HRT) and the direction of nystagmus was evaluated in a bow and lean test (BLT). The aim of this study is to compare the results of a BLT with those of a HRT for lateralization of HSCC-canalolithiasis and cupulopathy (heavy cupula and light cupula), and evaluate treatment outcomes in patients with HSCC-canalolithiasis. We conducted retrospective case reviews in 66 patients with HSCC-canalolithiasis and 63 patients with HSCC-cupulopathy. The affected side was identified as the direction of bowing nystagmus on BLT in 55 % (36 of 66) of patients with canalolithiasis, which was concordant with the HRT result in 67 % (24 of 36) of cases (concordant group). Lateralization was determined by comparison of nystagmus intensity during HRT in 30 patients who did not show bowing or leaning nystagmus. The remission rate after the first treatment was 71 % (17 of 24) in the concordant group and 45 % (5 of 11) in the discordant group. Both bowing and leaning nystagmus were observed in all patients with cupulopathy, and the side of the null plane was identified as the affected side. In conclusion, bowing and/or leaning nystagmus were observed in only 55 % of patients with HSCC-canalolithiasis, and the first treatment based on the result of BLT alone was effective in only 45 % of the patients in whom the BLT and HRT were discordant, which may suggest that the usefulness of BLT in lateralizing the HSCC-canalolithiasis may be limited. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a clinical syndrome that is proposed to be caused by dislocated utricular debris into semicircular canals. Although the majority of patients are treated by one or two repositioning maneuvers, some of the patients need repeated maneuvers for relief. The goal of this study was to investigate the factors associated with patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who required multiple repositioning procedures for treatment. Data were obtained from the clinical records of 153 patients diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Patients were treated by repositioning maneuvers. Demographic data and the factors including age, sex, canal type, duration of symptoms, comorbidities and number of repositioning maneuvers for relief were documented for statistical analysis. Age, sex, canal type and the duration of symptoms had no impact on the number of maneuvers. The most common comorbidity was spine problems. Hypertension was the only comorbidity that significantly associated with increased number of maneuvers. The presence of hypertension is a risk factor for repeated maneuvers in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo treatment. Physicians should be aware of the increased probability of repeated repositioning maneuvers in these group of patients. The role of comorbidities and vascular factors need to be further clarified in the course of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Recurrent episodes of vertigo are one of the most frequent reasons of referrals for medical help. In the Russian medicine, the development of vertigo is traditionally associated with a cerebral vascular pathology. It is suggested that correctly planned clinical neurovestibular study may identify the signs of a balance disorder of peripheral and central genesis. To increase the effectiveness of the differential diagnosis of peripheral and central vertigo in patients with recurrent episodes of balance disorders using the protocol of neurovestibular examination ALGORITM. The study included 120 outpatients with preliminary diagnoses of cerebral ischemia and autonomic vascular dystonia. Signs of lesion of peripheral and central regions of the vestibular system were found in 43.5 and 17.5% patients, respectively. Benign positional vertigo was the most frequent cause of vertigo while chronic cerebral ischemia was identified in 16.5% of the patients. Neurovestibularexamnation using the protocol ALGORITM is important for assessment of the level of vestibular system lesion. Iitis necessary to use it in complex examination of patients with complaints of vertigo.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vestibular vertigo. It is caused by dislodged otoconia that enters the semicircular canals. Its main symptom is relapsing positional vertigo. The provocative tests, in particular the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, are used to confirm the diagnosis. In case of positive result of the test, one of the maneuvers is peformed depending on the affected semicircular canal, for instance the Epley maneuver. It is important to differentiate BPPV from the vertigo of central origin. </td>

	<td>There is common agreement in the literature that it can result in an underestimation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the elderly. The aim of this work was to analyze the role of anamnesis in the diagnosis of BPPV in patients of different ages through the development and validation of a scored questionnaire. The questionnaire is based on the presence/absence of six typical anamnestic features of BPPV. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMS) was also administered to patients over 65 years of age. Bedsides, examination for BPPV was then carried out, assigning the outcome of the questionnaire and eventual MMS to the final diagnosis for each patient. The sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire for high scores (>8) were found to be, respectively, 86 % and 80 % in all patients, 94 and 71 % in those under 65 years of age, 78 and 90 % in patients over 65, and, in particular, 63 and 83 % in those with MMS >24 and 100 and 100 % in those with MMS ≤24. The reliability and average score of the questionnaire were statistically significantly lower in the group of elderly patients without cognitive deficits. The lower reliability of the questionnaire in the geriatric population, rather than the presence of cognitive deterioration, seems to correlate with other comorbidities or simply to a lower mobility of the head triggering positional symptoms. The use of the questionnaire could however reduce the risk of a missed diagnosis of BPPV given its good reliability across all ages.</td>

Sixty individuals with sex- and age-matched without vertigo and cerebral diseases served as the control. The morphological changes of intracranial arteries, perfusion parameters and vascular risk factors (VRFs) were analyzed, calculated and compared. In UIV patients, hypertension (HT), hyperlipidemia and number of VRFs≥3 occurred more commonly (P<0.0125, respectively).

The number of repositioning maneuver for Group A was 2 - 6 times (average: 4. 21±1. 18) while 2 - 3 times (average: 2. 29 ± 0. 46) for Group B. There was significant difference between the two groups(P<0. 01). The effective rate of initial treatment for Group A was 78. 9%(15/19) while 82. 2%(37/45)for Group B. After one weeks treatment, the effective rate for Group A changed to be 89. 5% (17/19)while 88. 9% (40/45) for Group B. Non-significant difference was found in the two groups neither in the initial nor one weeks treatment. On three months' follow-up, one in Group A and two in Group B relapsed, and they were cured after treated in the initial treatment. The recurrence for Group A was 5. 3%(1/19) while 4. 4%(2/45) for Group B and there was non-significant difference. The five cases with horizontal semicircular canal S-BPPV were completely free of disease after undergoing treatment. The sequential treatment is effective for both vertical semicircular canal S-BPPV and vertical semicircular canal O-BPPV, but the former needs more repositioning maneuver times. The repositioning maneuver, combined with drug therapy and head-shake-in-supine-position method is recommended for horizontal semicircular canal S-BPPV.</td>

	<td>The objective was to evaluate nystagmus intensity and direction (NID) during bow and lean test (BLT) in subjects suffering from idiopathic lateral semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (LSC-BPPV), in order to differentiate between the geotropic and the apogeotropic form and to determine the affected ear before using classic diagnostic procedures. The BLT was performed in 32 subjects affected by LSC-BPPV. "Nystagmus intensity" evaluation allows distinguishing the geotropic variant from the apogeotropic one, while the "nystagmus direction" allows identification of the side. In particular, a more intense nystagmus in the bow position compared to the lean position indicates an ampullipetal flow caused by the presence of free-floating particles in the non-ampullary arm, and is suggestive of geotropic form. In this case, if the nystagmus in the bow position is left beating, the free-floating particles necessarily occupy the left LSC non-ampullary arm, while a right-beating nystagmus indicates the right LSC involvement. In contrast, a more intense nystagmus in the lean position compared to the bow position indicates an ampullifugal flow due to the presence of particles adherent to the cupula (cupulolithiasis) or free-floating in the ampullary arm (canalolithiasis), suggesting an apogeotropic form. In this situation, if the nystagmus in the lean position is left beating, the particles are in the left LSC ampullar arm or are coated on the left LSC cupula; vice versa, a right-beating nystagmus in the lean position is suggestive of the involvement of the right LSC. As a general rule, in both forms the direction of the more intense nystagmus points to the affected side. "NID-BLT" was effective in identifying the form and the side in 22/28 subjects (79% of the study population). The proper execution and interpretation of the "NID-BLT" helps to establish the form (geotropic versus apogeotropic) and side (right versus left) in most cases of LSC-BPPV. Unlike Choung's test, which requires knowing a priori if the form is geotropic or apogeotropic, our test enables fast and accurate diagnosis, or at least provides indispensable elements if the diagnosis of the affected side is doubtful, with the patient remaining in the sitting position.</td>

Prospective cohort study. Academic center. Ninety-seven consecutive patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal were initially enrolled. Diagnosis was assessed according to clinical history and bedside evaluation. All patients were treated with CRPs until nystagmus disappeared. Three days after the successful treatment, presence of RD was investigated. If RD was present, patients were monitored every 3 days until the symptoms disappeared. Subjects who required ≥4 CRPs or who failed to meet the follow-up visit were excluded. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) was obtained from patients at the time of diagnosis and at every subsequent visit. At the end of selection, 86 patients were included; 33 (38.36%) reported RD after successful treatment. A significant difference in the incidence of RD was observed in consideration of the age of the subjects (P = .0003) and the DHI score at the time of diagnosis (P < .001). A logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of RD occurrence increased with the increase of the emotional subdomain score of the DHI questionnaire. RD is a common self-limited disorder, more frequent in the elderly, which may occur after the physical treatment for BPPV. The DHI score at the time of BPPV diagnosis represents a useful tool to quantify the impact of this vestibular disorder on the quality of life and to estimate the risk of RD after CRPs.</td>

Positional nystagmus was detected in 88% of the subjects. The most common finding was nystagmus in the Dix-Hallpike position, which occurred in 55% of the subjects. The 95th percentile of the maximum slow-phase velocity for each subject was found to be 5.06° per second (n = 54) in the horizontal plane and 6.48° per second (n = 48) in the vertical plane. Positional nystagmus is a common finding in normal subjects and occurred in 88% of the healthy subjects in the present study. Horizontal direction-changing apogeotropic or geotropic nystagmus may occur in asymptomatic subjects. However, nystagmus that is of the paroxysmal type or has a slow-phase velocity greater than approximately 5° per second in the horizontal plane or 6.5° per second in the vertical plane should be considered outside the 95th percentile.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) secondary to canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is perhaps the most frequent cause of vertigo and dizziness. One of its properties is a high response rate to canalith repositioning maneuvers. However, delays in the diagnosis and treatment of this entity can range from days to years, depending on the setting. Here, we present an abbreviated variation of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which can be used to diagnose this disease. It is similar to the standard maneuver but can be performed without an examination bed/table and requires only a backed chair (a difference that we feel is very important in settings where a clinical bed/table is not readily available). A diagnostic assessment study was conducted in 163 patients who presented with vertigo or dizziness. The abbreviated test had fairly good sensitivity (80%) and high specificity (95%) for diagnosing posterior BPPV. This new diagnostic maneuver may serve as a screening procedure for quickly identifying this pathology. This will allow patients to be more directly treated, without requiring unnecessary referrals or full vestibular testing, and will be especially useful in primary care settings or heavily overloaded otolaryngology or neurology departments.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is a symptom in which individuals experience a false sensation of movement. This type of dizziness is thought to originate in the inner ear labyrinth or its neural connections. It is a commonly experienced symptom and can cause significant problems with carrying out normal activities. Betahistine is a drug that may work by improving blood flow to the inner ear. This review examines whether betahistine is more effective than a placebo at treating symptoms of vertigo from different causes. To assess the effects of betahistine in patients with symptoms of vertigo from different causes. The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 8); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The date of the search was 21 September 2015. We included randomised controlled trials of betahistine versus placebo in patients of any age with vertigo from any neurotological diagnosis in any settings. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with reduction in vertigo symptoms (considering together the intensity, frequency and duration those symptoms). We included 17 studies, with a total of 1025 participants; 12 studies were published (567 patients) and five were unpublished (458 patients). Sixteen studies including 953 people compared betahistine with placebo. All studies with analysable data lasted three months or less. The majority were at high risk of bias, but in some the risk of bias was unclear. One study, at high risk of bias, included 72 people with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and compared betahistine with placebo; all patients also had particle repositioning manoeuvres. The studies varied considerably in terms of types of participants, their diagnoses, the dose of betahistine and the length of time it was taken for, the study methods and the way any improvement in vertigo symptoms was measured. Using the GRADE system, we judged the quality of evidence overall to be low for two outcomes (proportion of patients with improvement and proportion with adverse events).Pooled data showed that the proportion of patients reporting an overall reduction in their vertigo symptoms was higher in the group treated with betahistine than the placebo group: risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.60; 606 participants; 11 studies). This result should be interpreted with caution as the test for statistical heterogeneity as measured by the I(2) value was high.Adverse effects (mostly gastrointestinal symptoms and headache) were common but medically serious events in the study were rare and isolated: there was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects between the betahistine and placebo groups, where the rates were 16% and 15% respectively (weighted values, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.40; 819 participants; 12 studies).Sixteen per cent of patients from both the betahistine and the placebo groups withdrew (dropped out) from the studies (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42; 481 participants; eight studies).Three studies looked at objective vestibular function tests as an outcome; the numbers of participants were small, techniques of measurement very diverse and reporting details sparse, so analysis of this outcome was inconclusive.We looked for information on generic quality of life and falls, but none of the studies reported on these outcomes. Low quality evidence suggests that in patients suffering from vertigo from different causes there may be a positive effect of betahistine in terms of reduction in vertigo symptoms. Betahistine is generally well tolerated with a low risk of adverse events. Future research into the management of vertigo symptoms needs to use more rigorous methodology and include outcomes that matter to patients and their families.</td>

	<td>The history of surgery on the vestibular labyrinth is rich but sparsely documented in the literature. The story begins over a century ago with the labyrinthectomy in an era that consisted exclusively of ablative surgery for infection or vertigo. Improved understanding of vestibular physiology and pathology produced an era of selective ablation and hearing preservation that includes semicircular canal occlusion for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. An era of restoration began with a discovery of superior semicircular canal dehiscence and its repair. The final era of vestibular replacement is upon us as the possibility of successful prosthetic vestibular implantation becomes reality.</td>

	<td>This chapter gives an overview of the epidemiology of dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance, and of specific vestibular disorders. In the last decade, population-based epidemiologic studies have complemented previous publications from specialized settings and provided evidence for the high burden of dizziness and vertigo in the community. Dizziness (including vertigo) affects about 15% to over 20% of adults yearly in large population-based studies. Vestibular vertigo accounts for about a quarter of dizziness complaints and has a 12-month prevalence of 5% and an annual incidence of 1.4%. Its prevalence rises with age and is about two to three times higher in women than in men. Imbalance has been increasingly studied as a highly prevalent complaint particularly affecting healthy aging. Studies have documented the high prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vestibular migraine (VM), as well as of comorbid anxiety at the population level. BPPV and VM are largely underdiagnosed, while Menière's disease, which is about 10 times less frequent than BPPV, appears to be overdiagnosed. Risk factor research is only at its beginning, but has provided some interesting observations, such as the consistent association of vertigo and migraine, which has greatly contributed to the recognition of VM as a distinct vestibular syndrome. </td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common labyrinthine disorder caused by a mechanic stimulation of the vestibular receptors within the semicircular canals. It is characterized by positional vertigo and positional nystagmus, both provoked by changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. The social impact of the disease and its direct and indirect costs to healthcare systems are significant owing to impairment of daily activities and increased risk of falls. The first description of a patient with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is from Robert Bárány in 1921, but the features of the syndrome and the diagnostic maneuver were well described by Dix and Hallpike in 1952. Since then, the gradually increasing interest of otolaryngologists and neurologists has led to a progressive advance in the knowledge of this labyrinthine disorder with regard to its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects. Despite the often effective diagnosis and treatment of most cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the physiopathologic explanations of the disease are mainly speculative. In this chapter, we describe the epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. </td>

	<td>To evaluate the effect of time between the movements/steps, angle of body movements as well as the angular velocity of the maneuvers in an   model of a semicircular canal (SCC) to improve the efficacy of the Sémont maneuver (SM) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Sémont maneuvers were performed on an   SCC model. Otoconia trajectories were captured by a video camera. The effects of time between the movements, angles of motion (0°, 10°, 20°, and 30° below the horizontal line), different angular velocities (90, 135, 180°/s), and otoconia size (36 and 50 μm) on the final position of the otoconia in the SCC were tested. Without extension of the movements beyond the horizontal, the   experiments (with particles corresponding to 50 μm diameter) did not yield successful canalith repositioning. If the movements were extended by 20° beyond the horizontal position, SM were successful with resting times of at least 16 s. For larger extension angles, the required time decreased. However, for smaller particles (36 μm), the required time doubled. The angular maneuver velocity (tested between 90 and 180°/s) did not have a major impact on the final position of the otoconia. The two primary determinants for success of the SM are the time between the movements and the extension of the movements beyond the horizontal. The time between the movements should be at least 45 s. Angles of 20° or more below horizontal line (so-called Sémont+) should increase the success rate of SM.</td>

Age, gender, main complaint, and clinical diagnosis were noted on a chart and analyzed. In 2012, a total of 19,875 patients attended the otolaryngology department between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., of whom 418 (2.1%) were aged ≥65 years. The most common complaints were ear and hearing disorders (24.2%), epistaxis(15.3%), balance disorders (15.1%), pharyngotonsillar pathologies (14.8%), and head and facial trauma (9.6%). This study shows that the changing patient population will change the type and frequencies of pathologies seen in general otolaryngology practices. Geriatric patients need a targeted approach to their diseases because they have special issues unique to their population. </td>

	<td>A pathological nystagmus is an objective sign that a patient feels vertigo. However, there have been few opportunities to observe and record pathological nystagmus during a paroxysmal vertigo attack. Furthermore, it can be difficult to obtain cooperation in pediatric patients. We present two cases of paroxysmal vertigo in children in whom we successfully recorded and analyzed their pathological nystagmus during a vertigo attack. Of a total sample of 4349 patients seen at our hospital for dizziness in the last decade, a retrospective analysis revealed that 68 were children (<15 years old; 1.6%). Of these 68 children, we successfully identified pathological nystagmus during paroxysmal vertigo in only two (2.9%). Case 1 was a 4-year-old girl. She felt vertigo the strongest when her left ear was down in the supine position. We observed and recorded her nystagmus during a vertigo attack with her mother's permission. Her positional nystagmus in the supine position was horizontal persistent apogeotropic nystagmus. Rightward nystagmus in the left-ear-down supine position was stronger than leftward nystagmus in the right-ear-down supine position. Therefore, the diagnosis was right lateral canal type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, of which the pathophysiology was cupulolithiasis. The other patient was an 11-year-old boy. He had a family history of migraines. His vertigo attacks occurred after onset of a severe migraine and lasted between 2 and 48 h. During an attack that we observed, he showed nystagmus, which was direction-fixed right torsional and rightward in darkness. His mother had noticed that his eyes moved abnormally and that his left eye did not shift to the left side when he looked leftward. He was old enough to clearly express his own symptoms. Other neurological examinations were normal. The diagnosis was vestibular migraine. We analyzed a pathological nystagmus during paroxysmal vertigo in two children. We conclude that children can be diagnosed with a combination of careful history taking and accurate examinations of a pathological nystagmus.</td>

	<td>The clinician's major role in management of the dizzy patient involves determining what dizziness is vertigo, and what vertigo is of central or peripheral origin. These demand attention to details of history, otolaryngological workup including vestibular assessment, and often use of diagnostic and management algorithms. There is paucity of published reports of the management outcomes of peripheral vestibular diseases from Africa. Two tertiary care otologist-led dedicated vertigo clinics are located in Abuja, Nigeria. A prospective, non-randomized study of patients presenting with features of peripheral vestibular diseases attending the National Hospital Abuja Nigeria (between May 2005 and April 2014) and CSR Otologics Specialist Clinics (May 2010 to April 2014) was carried out. Both institutions adopted the same diagnostic and management protocols. Data extracted from anonymized databases created for this study include age, sex, vertigo duration (acute <12 weeks, chronic >12 weeks), dizziness handicap inventory score at presentation and at subsequent visits, otological and vestibular findings, ice-water caloric testing results, other investigation outcomes, treatments offered and outcomes. 561/575 (97.5 %) of the cases recorded had peripheral vestibular disease. The male-to-female ratio was 290:271. The mean age of the subjects was 44.7 years. Duration of vertigo at presentation was acute in 278 subjects and chronic in 283 subjects. Identifiable clinical diagnostic groups include BPPV (n = 200), Meniere's disease (n = 189), cervicogenic vertigo (n = 35), labyrinthitis (n = 32), Migraine-associated vertigo (MAV) (n = 32), cholesteatoma/perilymph Fistula (n = 10), climacteric vertigo (n = 8) and unclassified vertigo (n = 55). Migraine-associated vertigo recorded the highest DHI score (95 % CI 75 ± 4.3), followed by cholesteatoma/perilymph fistula (95 % CI 72 ± 6.1) and labyrinthitis (95 % CI 62 ± 1.9). Pure tone audiometry (95 % CI 67.3 ± 3.43), followed by thyroid function tests (95 % CI 66.7 ± 23.55) and ice-water caloric testing (95 % CI 59.7 ± 2.69) were investigations with the highest yields. 86.5 % of cases were treated by either vestibular suppressant medications alone (n = 285) and/or particle repositioning maneuver (n = 200) with improvement in vertigo control (95 % CI 63.63 to 74.37 % and 62.59 to 75.41 %, respectively). Peripheral vestibular diseases constitute majority of cases of self-reported vertigo seen in our setting. Migraine-associated vertigo seen in our setting all have peripheral vestibular signs. Dedicated vertigo clinics could significantly improve the diagnostic and treatment yield in a resource-constrained setting like ours. Most cases can be managed using non-operative measures.</td>

Patients in the BPPV group received the CRP at baseline and repeatedly until a negative Dix-Hallpike Maneuver was observed. Participants in the other two groups did not receive the CRP. Symptom resolution at the 12-week follow-up was observed in 75% of patients in the BPPV group versus 8.3% in the nonspecific dizziness group (p = .0006). A significant Group × Time interaction was observed for the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (F = 4.2, p = .003) and 36-item Short Form Health Questionnaire physical component scores (F = 2.16, p = .035) with the BPPV group showing significantly improved scores by the 12-week follow-up. Although there were between-group differences on the 36-item Short Form Health Questionnaire mental health component scores (F = 4.06, p = .022), changes over time were not significant in the groups. Treatment with the CRP for posttraumatic BPPV resulted in significant symptom resolution and improvement in perceived physical health status.</td>

	<td>The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of vertigo and to determine the type of the lesion of the vestibular analyzer in the patients presenting with acute sensorineural loss of hearing (ASNLH). The secondary objective was to evaluate the possibility of the restoration of the auditory thresholds. The results of the examination and treatment of 94 patients suffering from ASNLH are presented. It was shown that the development of acute sensorineural loss of hearing was accompanied by unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy in 22.3% of the patients. In 5.3% of these cases, dizziness could be attributed to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and canalolythias is of the posterior semicircular canal on the side of hearing impairment. It is concluded that the presence of the clinical signs of lesions of the vestibular analyzer and peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the form of latent spontaneous nystagmus without gaze fixation and/or asymmetric nystagmus with unilateral weakness in the caloric test is a negative prognostic factor for the restoration of the auditory thresholds in the patients presenting with acute sensorineural loss of hearing.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in older adults. Beyond the unpleasant sensation of vertigo, BPPV also negatively affects older adults' gait and balance and increases their risk of falling. As such it has a profound effect on function, independence, and quality of life. Otoconia are the inner ear structures that help detect horizontal and vertical movements. Aging contributes to the fragmentation of otoconia, whose displacement into the semicircular, most commonly posterior canals, can produce rotatory movement sensations with head movement. BPPV is more commonly idiopathic in older adults than in younger individuals, can present atypically, and has a more-protracted course and higher risk of recurrence. Medications such as meclizine that are commonly prescribed for BPPV can be associated with significant side effects. Dix-Hallpike and Head Roll tests can generally identify the involved canal. Symptoms resolve as otoconia fragments dissolve into the endolymph, but appropriate canalith repositioning (e.g., Epley maneuver) can expedite recovery and reduce the burden of this disorder. Observations suggesting an association between idiopathic BPPV and vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis indicate that BPPV may share risk factors with other common geriatric conditions, which highlights the importance of moving beyond purely otological considerations and addressing the needs of older adults with vertigo through a systems-based multidisciplinary approach. </td>

	<td>National and international evidence and guidelines on falls prevention and management in community-dwelling elderly adults recommend that falls services should be multifactorial and their interventions multicomponent. The way that individuals are identified as having had or being at risk of falls in order to take advantage of such services is far less clear. A novel multidisciplinary, multifactorial falls, syncope, and dizziness service model was designed with enhanced case ascertainment through proactive, primary care-based screening (of individual case notes of individuals aged ≥60) for individual fall risk factors. The service model identified 4,039 individuals, of whom 2,232 had significant gait and balance abnormalities according to senior physiotherapist assessment. Significant numbers of individuals with new diagnoses ranging from cognitive impairment to Parkinson's disease to urgent indications for a pacemaker were discovered. More than 600 individuals were found who were at high risk of osteoporosis according to World Health Association Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score, 179 with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo and 50 with atrial fibrillation. Through such screening and this approach, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Plus (Plus falls, syncope and dizziness expertise), unmet need was targeted on a scale far outside the numbers seen in clinical trials. Further work is needed to determine whether this approach translates into fewer falls and decreases in syncope and dizziness.</td>

Nine patients with persistent posterior canal BPPV after 6 or more repositioning maneuvers were treated by ITMP (two weekly doses of 0.3-0.4 mL at 40 mg/mL) before repeating the repositioning procedures. Following ITMP treatment, 7 out of 9 patients were relieved of their symptoms and did not exhibit positional nystagmus after 1 or 2 repositioning maneuvers. The number of positional maneuvers performed before and after ITMP treatment in these 7 patients showed a statistically significant (p=0.016) reduction in the amount of repositioning treatments required. None of the 7 respondent patients showed any relapses during the follow-up period (follow-up range: 11-95 months).

Retrospective review of medical records (chart review). A total of 475 patients aged from 14 to 87 years, affected by BPPV. Recurrence of BPPV occurred in 139/475 patients (29.2%). The recurrence rate was significantly higher in female and older patients. Comorbidities were present in 72.6% of subjects with recurrent BPPV vs. 48.9% of patients with no recurrence (p < 0.01). Forty-two patients (8.8%) reported a cranial trauma as a triggering event. Post-traumatic patients showed a significantly higher persistence rate (45.2%) compared to patients affected by non-traumatic BPPV (20.5%). Recurrence rates are overlapping between the two groups. Our results confirm the association between recurrence of BPPV and age, female sex, and presence of comorbidities. The correlation is stronger in patients affected by multiple associated diseases; the most frequently involved pathologies are psychiatric disorders, followed by neurological and vascular diseases. Collecting a complete medical history is important for prognostic stratification and detection of potential underlying pathological conditions.</td>

One hundred and thirty-two patients with BPPV were randomly divided into two groups ,one group underwent the traditional manip- ulative reduction, the other group with TRV-CRP. DRI and VAS was evaluated in the pre and after treatment and evaluation of the efficacy was conducted. The results of two groups were compared. The effective rate of manipulative reduction after a week treatment was 89. 23% and TRV-CRP.was 98. 51%, which was higher in TRV-CRP group than that of the manipulation reduction group(P<0. 05). The comfort degree of the manipulation reduction group was 4. 54±2. 48,higher than the TRV-CRP group which was 5. 48±1. 44 (P<0. 05). The score of DHI showed no significant difference before treatment between manipulation reduction group and TRV-CRP group(P>0. 05), the score of the two groups were decreased after a week of reduction, but the improvement of TRV-CRP group was higher than that of manipulation reduction group(P<0. 05). The success rate of TRV-CRP was higher than that of manipulative reduction,but manipulative reduction comfort degree was higher than TRV-CRP, the two methods can both improve the quality of life of patients with BPPV. TRV-CRP has many advantages over manipulative reduction, but manipulative reduction is simple with low cost, and the effect is still a great advantage. In clinical work, we should reasonable combine the two methods,so as to improve the cure rate of RPPV.</td>

	<td>Vestibular problems after cochlear implantation (CI) were explored by categorizing them according to clinical course and changes in objective vestibular function. The changes in vestibular function of 62 patients (66 ears) were analyzed and vestibular symptoms were divided into three categories by their time course and nature. Etiologies were determined by analyzing the symptoms in combination with changes in objective vestibular function, measured using the caloric and/or video head impulse test. Before surgery, vestibular function was normal in 31 cases (47.0 %), unilaterally hypofunctional in 14 (21.2 %), and bilaterally hypofunctional in 21 (31.8 %). Eight cases (12.1 %) reported dizziness before surgery. A total of 18 cases (27.3 %) experienced postoperative dizziness. Ten patients experienced immediate transient dizziness (including 2 cases of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo); four experienced immediate prolonged dizziness (including 3 cases of bilateral vestibular hypofunction); and four experienced recurrent episodic dizziness (including 3 cases of suspicious endolymphatic hydrops). The sums of the maximal slow-phase velocities (SPVs) of the implanted ears were changed from 22.70 ± 17.31 to 12.55 ± 12.02°/s after implantation (p = 0.004) with very little changes in the other side (32.65 ± 24.85-31.40 ± 29.10°/s). Careful review of vestibular status is an important step, especially when deciding implantation in the only vestibular functioning ear or bilateral implantation.</td>

Case series. A retrospective review of 232 patients diagnosed with BPPV visiting the clinic between June 2014 and June 2015 was performed. All patients underwent a complete otolaryngological, audiologic, and neurologic evaluation. The appropriate particle-repositioning maneuver was performed depending on the type of BPPV. The patients were divided into the recurrence group and the nonrecurrence group. Age, gender, follow-up period, type of BPPV, and vitamin D concentrations in the two groups were compared and analyzed through binary logistic regression analyses. The average follow-up period after treatment was 10.2 months. Forty-one (17.7%) of 232 patients suffered a recurrence during the follow-up period. The mean vitamin D concentration of 191 patients who did not suffer any recurrence was 16.63 ng/mL, whereas that of 41 patients who suffered a recurrence was 13.64 ng/mL. This difference in vitamin D concentrations was statistically significant (  < 0.019). The patients' age, gender, follow-up period, and type of BPPV had no statistically significant impact. Vitamin D is assumed to affect BPPV as a recurrence factor independent of age, gender, follow-up period, and type of BPPV. 4.</td>

The participants were assessed at baseline (T0), one (T1), five (T5), nine (T9), and thirteen weeks (T13). We assessed the differences between the groups by Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests, and used the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests to determine the intragroup differences.   No significant differences were found between groups for the positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test, recurrence, and number of maneuvers to achieve a negative test. The number of maneuvers to achieve negative Dix-Hallpike test was lower in intragroup comparisons in the experimental group.   The findings suggest that additional Vestibular Rehabilitation did not influence the positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test, recurrence, or number of maneuvers to achieve a negative test in elderly patients with chronic Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is probably the most common diagnosis at vertigo clinics. Seasonal cycles of several human illnesses could be attributed variously to changes in atmospheric or weather conditions. In this retrospective study, patients with BPPV from January 2010 to December 2012 were studied, and their charts were reviewed. Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in patients' numbers among different months of the year. Also there is a significant statistical correlation between the numbers of patients with climatic variations especially the temperature. The present paper discusses the possible explanations for these results which confirms the seasonal variations in BPPV, together with a review of literature to view the possible associations with other disorders that causes such seasonality.</td>

Twenty patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) and 20 patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis (VN) were included in the study. Serum samples were analysed at the initial presentation and on the seventh day of admission retrospectively. The WBC (white blood cell) count was 10500±2100 /mm3, the neutrophil count was 4700±1100/mm3, the lymphocyte count was 5000±1200/mm3 and the NLR was 0.9±0.2 in the VN group. In patients with BPPV, the WBC count was 9200±1300/mm3, the neutrophil count was 5200±1200/mm3, the lymphocyte count was 3100±1200/mm3 and the NLR was 1.9±0.9. The NLR was lower in patients with VN than in patients diagnosed with BPPV. The WBC and lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the patients with VN than in the patients diagnosed with BPPV. Within the first week of admission, the WBC and lymphocyte counts in patients with VN decreased, and the NLR was more elevated than at the admission. It is highly recommended that NLR is used in the diagnosis and follow-up of the most commonly observed aetiological factors of peripheral vertigo, BPPV and VN. </td>

Prospective cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine patients with EGPA, considered controlled according to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score and the Vasculitis Damage Index, underwent a complete audiologic evalutaion with otomicroscopy, impedance audiometry, speech audiometry, and auditory brainstem responses; rhinologic evaluation was made by means of fiberoptic endoscopy and nasal cytology; the clinical evaluation was completed with analysis of the facial function and, in patients with referred vertigo, with videonystagmography (VNG). Data were compared to the rheumatologic profile (eosinophil count, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies status). Thirty-four of 39 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of those, 18 (52, 8%) were affected by variable degrees of hearing loss (sensorineural hearing loss [SNHL]) in four cases (11, 8%), mixed sensorineural and conductive hearing loss in two (5, 9%), presbycusis in six (17, 6%), and otitis media with effusion (OME) in six (17, 6%). Vestibular impairment was represented by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and unspecific dizziness in three (8, 8%) and four cases (11, 8%), respectively, all with normal VNG. Ear involvement was statistically related to the EGPA vasculitic pattern and independent from the nasal impairment, cytology, and duration of nasal symptoms. No facial palsy was registered. In our experience, the largest in the existing literature, the otological involvement in EGPA is common and may occur variably as SNHL or OME. Otological involvement occurs early in the course of the disease process, but is nonspecific in making the diagnosis of EGPA. Its recognition is therefore fundamental. 4.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition with recurrent attacks in a significant proportion of patients. The present case- control study was conducted to assess the influence of serum vitamin D normalization on recurrent attacks of vitamin D deficient patients. Diagnosis of BPPV was made based on history and clinical examination and exclusion of other conditions. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) was measured using ELISA method and a levels of < 20 ng/ml was considered a deficiency of vitamin D. Inclusion criteria were as follows: history of recurrent attacks and serum 25-OHD<20.ng/ml. While the patients with history of trauma, surgery and chronic systemic diseases were excluded. The patients were classified into two groups: treatment and control, intermittently. Both groups received Epley rehabilitation therapy one session per week for 4 weeks but the treatment group received an additional supplement of 50.000 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) weekly for two months to achieve serum 25-OHD ≥ 30 ng/ml and the study patients were followed-up for 6 months. Twenty-seven patients were allocated to each group. At baseline, serum 25-OHD was similar (10.7±2.3 vs 11.41±1.9, P=0.23). At month 2, serum 25-OHD in the treatment group increased significantly to ≥ 30 ng/ ml, whereas serum 25-OHD in the control group remained unchanged (34.2±3.3 vs 10.6 10.6±2.2 ng/ml, P=0.001). During the follow-up period, attacks of BPPV in the treatment group decreased significantly compared with the control group (14.8% vs 96.3% OR= 0.18, P=0.001). The findings of this study indicate that the normalization of serum vitamin D significantly reduces BPPV recurrences.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is linked to vitamin D deficiency. This clinical trial aimed to determine the influence of vitamin D supplementation on intensity of BPPV. The study population was selected consecutively and the diagnosis of BPPV was made by history and clinical examination and exclusion of other conditions. Intensity of BPVV was assessed based on VAS score (0-10). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) was measured using ELISA method and levels < 20 ng/ml was considered a deficiency. All patients received rehabilitation treatment using Epley's maneuver one time per week for one month. Serum 25-OHD deficient patients were classified as treated and non-treated groups (rehabilitation with or without 50.000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for two months).The results of treatment were compared with vitamin D sufficient group as control. All patients were followed-up for 6 months. After two months of treatment, in both vitamin D treated and non-treated groups the intensity of BPPV decreased significantly as compared with control (P=0.001 for both groups) but at endpoint, the intensity of BPPV aggravated and regressed to the baseline value in vitamin D deficient non-treated group (P=0.001) whereas, in vitamin D treated group, improvement of BPPV remained stable and unchanged over the study period. This study indicates that correction of vitamin D deficiency in BPPV provides additional benefit to rehabilitation therapy (Epley maneuver) regarding duration of improvement. These findings suggest serum 25-OHD measurement in recurrent BPPV.</td>

	<td>Introduction Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common and treatable causes of peripheral vestibular vertigo in adults. Its incidence increases with age, eventually leading to disability and a decreased quality of life. Objective The research aims to assess short-term effects of Otolith Repositioning Maneuver (ORM) on dizziness symptoms, quality of life, and postural balance in elderly people with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Methods A quasi-experimental study, which evaluated 14 elderly people that underwent the Otolith Repositioning Maneuver and reevaluation after one week. The authors performed statistical analysis by descriptive analysis of central tendency and dispersion; for pre- and post-treatment conditions, the authors used the Wilcoxon test. Results All aspects of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (physical, functional, emotional, and total scores) as well as the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) decreased after therapy (p < 0.05 and p = 0.001, respectively). However, more than half of the elderly participants did not achieve negative Dix-Hallpike. Regarding static and dynamic balance, there were significant differences in some parameters of the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, Limits of Stability and gait assessment measured by the Dizziness Gait Index (p < 0.05). Conclusion Results reveal clinical and functional benefits in elderly people with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo submitted to Otolith Repositioning Maneuver. However, most of the participants did not overcome Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and not all aspects of postural balance improved. Therefore, a longer follow-up period and a multidisciplinary team are required to establish comprehensive care for elderly patients with dizziness complaints. </td>

	<td>Utility of frequency tuning of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) for evaluation of utricular function in individuals with Meniere's disease is a recent development. However, there is dearth of studies regarding its utility in differential diagnosis of Meniere's disease from other vestibular pathologies. The present study aimed at investigating the feasibility of frequency tuning of oVEMP in discriminating Meniere's disease from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Static group comparison. oVEMPs were acquired from 36 individuals, each with unilateral Meniere's disease and unilateral BPPV. Thirty-six age- and gender-matched healthy individuals formed comparison group for each of the two clinical groups. Contralateral oVEMPs were recorded from both ears of all the participants. The responses pertaining to octave and mid-octave frequencies from 250 to 4000 Hz, one frequency presented at a time, were recorded from infra-orbital electrodes (noninverting placed 1 cm below the lower eyelid and inverting 2 cm below the inverting on the cheek) with forehead as ground. Starting intensity was 125 dB peSPL with subsequent reductions in 10-dB steps to arrive at threshold. The stimuli were delivered to the ear at a rate of 5.1 Hz. The frequency corresponding to the largest peak-to-peak amplitude, best threshold, and/or largest peak-to-peak amplitude at thresholds was considered as the tuning frequency. Proportions of ears with frequency tuning at a particular frequency were compared between the groups. The frequency tuning at 1000 Hz was found to exist in a significantly higher proportion of affected ears with Meniere's disease than the comparison group as well as ears with BPPV (p < 0.05). Using a criterion point of frequency tuning at 875 Hz, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying Meniere's disease was found to be 68% and 100%, respectively. The shift in frequency tuning is an efficient parameter for not only discriminating Meniere's disease from healthy individuals but also distinguishing it from BPPV. Therefore, frequency tuning is recommended as a test parameter of oVEMP for identification of Meniere's disease.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) constitutes a major proportion of the population with peripheral vestibulopathies. Although the freely floating otoconia within the semicircular canals is responsible for the symptoms of BPPV, the source of the otoconia debris is mainly believed to be the otolith organs. Therefore, the pathology in either or both the otolith organs appears a logical proposition. Cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP and oVEMP), being the tests for functional integrity of the otolith organs, appear promising for investigating otolith involvement in BPPV. While recent evidences are suggestive of equivocal findings for cVEMP, there are only a few studies on oVEMP. Additionally, both these potentials have never been explored in the same set of individuals with BPPV. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the functional integrity of the otolith organs through cVEMP and oVEMP in individuals with posterior canal BPPV. Thirty-one individuals with unilateral posterior canal BPPV and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent 500 Hz tone-burst-evoked cVEMP and oVEMP. The results demonstrated no significant group difference on any of the cVEMP parameters (p > 0.05). A similar trend was noticed for the latency-related parameters of oVEMP. However, the peak-to-peak amplitude was significantly smaller in the affected ears of individuals with BPPV than their unaffected ears and the ears of healthy controls (p < 0.05). The BPPV group showed significantly higher inter-aural amplitude difference ratio than the healthy controls (p < 0.05). Further, the sensitivity and specificity of oVEMP were also found to be far superior to those of cVEMP. Thus, the outcome of the present study revealed involvement of utricle rather than saccule in posterior canal BPPV, and therefore, oVEMP appears to be better suited to clinical investigation than cVEMP in individuals with posterior canal BPPV. </td>

	<td>Balance disorders are common in adult patients but less usual in the pediatric population. When this symptomatology appears in children it is a cause for concern, both for parents and health-care professionals. To explain the balance disorders in children describing a case series and to discuss the main etiologies found according to age. A retrospective, observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients aged 1-18 years who consulted because of balance disorders at the otolaryngology department of a pediatric tertiary-care hospital between March 2012 and July 2015. Two hundred and six patients were included in the study. Median age was 10 years. The most common diagnoses were vestibular migraine in 21.8% of the children, ataxia in 9.22%, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood in 7.77%, and post-traumatic vertigo in 6.31%.Overall, 61 videonystagmographies- of which 46 were normal - and 55 video head impulse tests - which were normal in 45 and showed abnormalities in the vestibulo-ocular reflex gain in 10 - were performed. In a child with balance disorders, the medical history and neurotological examination are essential. Vestibular migraine is the most commonly found disorder in every age group, and most of the patients have a family history of migraine. Ancillary studies, especially the video head-impulse test, provide important data to confirm the diagnosis.</td>

	<td>This paper describes the diagnostic criteria for vestibular paroxysmia (VP) as defined by the Classification Committee of the Bárány Society. The diagnosis of VP is mainly based on the patient history and requires: A) at least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 1 minute; C) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; D) response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine; and F) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Probable VP is defined as follows: A) at least five attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 5 minutes; C) spontaneous occurrence or provoked by certain head-movements; D) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; E) not better accounted for by another diagnosis.Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the 8th cranial nerve, which is covered by oligodendrocytes, are the assumed mechanism. Important differential diagnoses are Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, epileptic vestibular aura, paroxysmal brainstem attacks (in multiple sclerosis or after brainstem stroke), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymph fistula, transient ischemic attacks and panic attacks. Current areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis of VP are: a) MRI findings of vascular compression which are not diagnostic of the disease or predictive for the affected side because they are also observed in about 30% of healthy asymptomatic subjects; and b) response to treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine supports the diagnosis but there are so far no randomized controlled trials for treatment of VP.</td>

	<td>This retrospective study was conducted to determine the relationship between variable factors and the recurrence rate of post-semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PSC-BPPV) after canalith repositioning procedure (CRP). Patients with PSC-BPPV were diagnosed by history and the presence of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver between 2008 and 2010. In total, 243 patients (47 males and 196 females, average age = 57.5 -years) treated with Epley's maneuver or canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) were included in the study. The demographic factors studied were age, sex, sleep disorders, inner ear diseases, head trauma history, and cardiovascular diseases. Multivariate statistics using SPSS version 15, Pearson's Chi-squared test (χ2), Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used for the analysis. The success rate of vertigo control after the initial CRP was 83.1 %. Pearson's χ2 test results showed that females and participants with sleep disorders exhibited a significant difference in the recurrence of vertigo after the initial CRP. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test survival analysis revealed that the recurrence was associated with females and participants with sleep disorders and inner ear diseases.However, Cox proportional hazards regression showed no differences in recurrences associated with old age, sex, sleep disorders, inner ear diseases, head trauma, and cardiovascular diseases. Epley's maneuver or CRP is an effective, safe, and simple treatment for BPPV. Females and participants with sleep disorders and inner ear diseases are likely associated with the recurrence of BPPV after CRP.</td>

	<td>Several studies correlated between vitamin D deficiency and the development, and the recurrence of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV), but none of them proved that treatment of vitamin D deficiency would reduce the recurrence rate of BPPV. This study aims to detect the effect of treatment of severe vitamin D deficiency on the recurrence rate of BPPV. The inclusion criteria of the study group were: (1) Unilateral, idiopathic, posterior canal BPPV with no history suggestive of secondary BPPV and (2) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level ≤10 ng/ml. All subjects enrolled in the current study underwent detailed clinical history, audiovestibular evaluation consisting of pure-tone audiometry, Immittancemetry, Videonystugmography, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 assessment, and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Vitamin D therapy was prescribed for the study group. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level was evaluated twice, on recruitment into the study group and 3 months after commencing vitamin D therapy. According to the results of the second evaluation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the study group was subdivided into two subgroups: Subgroup (I): including 28 subjects who disclosed elevation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level; improvement ≥10 ng/ml. Subgroup (II): including 65 patients who disclosed elevation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels <10 ng/ml. The study group was followed up for 18 months in order to observe the recurrence of BPPV. The differences between both study subgroups (I) &amp; (II) regarding age, sex distribution, and bone mineral density were insignificant. The number of subjects who had recurrence of BPPV in subgroup (I) was 4 (14%) versus 28 subjects (43%) in subgroup (II). The mean values for recurrent attacks/subject in subgroups (I) &amp; (II) were 0.18, and 0.66 attack/subject respectively; these differences between both subgroups were of high statistical significance (p<0.01). The Odds Ratio for development of recurrence of BPPV in subjects with severe vitamin D deficiency was 4.54 (95% CI: 1.41-14.58, p<0.01). The relapse attacks of BPPV affected both ears irrespective of the ear showing the original BPPV attack. The present study indicates that improvement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels is associated with substantial decrease in recurrence of BPPV.</td>

	<td>To develop a three-dimensional study tool of the membranous labyrinth in order to study the pathophysiology, diagnostic workup and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. Its diagnosis and treatment depend on an understanding of the anatomy of the vestibular labyrinth and its position relative to the head. To date, many illustrations have been made to explain principals of diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, but few have been based on anatomical studies of the membranous labyrinth. A cadaveric human membranous labyrinth was axially sectioned at 20 μm resolution, stained and segmented to create a high-resolution digital model. The model was cloned to create an enantiomeric pair of labyrinths. These were associated a 3D model of a human skull, segmented from MRI data, and were oriented according to established anatomic norms. Canal markers representing otoliths were created to mark canalith position during movement of the model within the 3D environment. The model allows visualization of true membranous labyrinth anatomy in both ears simultaneously. The dependent portion of each semicircular duct and of the utricle can easily be visualized in any head position. Moveable markers can mark the expected progress of otolith debris with changes in head position and images can be captured to document simulations. The model can be used to simulate pathology as well as diagnostic maneuvers and treatment procedures used for BPPV. The model has great potential as a teaching tool. A simple model based on human anatomy has been created to allow careful study of BPPV pathophysiology and treatment. Going forward, this tool could offer insights that may lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment of BPPV.</td>

Dix-Hallpike (DH) tests were performed to categorize the treatment outcome as follows: 'symptom free' if the result was negative, 'symptom persistent' if the result remained positive after performing the maneuver 3 times or 'canal conversion' if horizontal nystagmus was evoked. Of the patients in the SSM and MSM groups, 78.4 and 91.5% became symptom free, respectively, while canal conversion occurred in 13.8 and 5.1%, respectively (p = 0.003, χ(2) test). The success rate after performing the maneuver once was 57.1% in the MSM and 32.3% in the SSM symptom-free patients (p = 0.001, χ(2) test). One month after the treatment, 22.0 and 9.6% of the SSM and MSM patients had symptom relapse, respectively (p = 0.007, χ(2) test). More accelerations and a smaller rotation angle improved the effectiveness and efficiency of the repositioning maneuvers and reduced canal conversion.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common complaints encountered in clinics and is strongly correlated with advanced age or, possibly, degeneration. Redistribution exercises are the most effective approaches to treat BPPV, and canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) cure most BPPV cases. However, the mechanisms through which the treatment modulates systemic molecules in BPPV patients remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that the miR-34a and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) genes correlated with the treatment effects of CRP in BPPV subjects. We found that miR-34a expression was largely inhibited and SIRT1 expression was significantly reversed after BPPV maneuver treatment. We also confirmed that the PPAR-γ, PGC-1 and FoxO gene expressions were decreased immediately after canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) for BPPV, and were largely increased after a complete cure of BPPV. Moreover, we observed that after a complete recovery of BPPV, the ROS concentrations, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and p53 expression levels were attenuated. We conclude that BPPV treatment might involve some epigenetic regulations through the mediation of miR-34a, SIRT1 functions and repression of redox status.</td>

She denied all styling practices that used traction or chemical processes, although she admitted to hair dye and blow dryer use. She reported "acne" in the central face for decades and darkening of the skin on the lateral face for several years. Her medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and treated breast ductal hyperplasia. Her medications were metoprolol, amlodipine, aspirin, levothyroxine, omeprazole, pravastatin, and meclizine; she denied starting any new medications within the past 2 years. Her family history was notable for androgenic pattern alopecia in a brother and a high hairline in her father. Review of systems was negative except for knee arthralgias and seasonal allergic rhinitis. </td>

	<td>Otoconia are calcite-based nanocomposites containing >90 % calcite and <10 % organic material. The mean size is approximately 10 µm. The external structure of all otoconia in the utricle and saccule is similar, with a cylindrical bulbous body with a slightly hexagonal contour. The internal structure consists of a composite with varying volume thickness, dense branching structures (branches) and less dense surrounding areas (bellies). Intact otoconia can be clearly identified only by scanning electron microscopy. In the case of morphological changes (e.g. due to "degeneration") the origin of even very small particles of otoconia can be assigned using physical and chemical analytical methods. The inorganic component of otoconia (calcite) is extremely sensitive to chemical influences, which leads to morphological alterations. A "degeneration" of otoconia can be objectively accomplished in vitro by alterations in pH, electrolyte imbalance and by the influence of complex formation. These three main processes then lead to irreversible morphological alterations. Artificial (biomimetic) otoconia serve as a suitable model system for detailed investigation of growth and degenerative processes. </td>

	<td>To investigate and analyze the state of anxiety and depression among patients with different type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(BPPV). Patients with four types of BPPV were enrolled in our study,which named as posterior semicircular canals BPPV(PC-BPPV),anterior semicircular canals BPPV(AC-BPPV), horizontal semicircular canals BPPV(HC-BPPV), multiple canals BPPV(MC-BPPV).Thorough otological and neuro-otological examinations were performed on all cases,and their states of anxiety and depression were assessed by hospital anxiety and depression scale(HADS). The incidence of anxiety and depression of all cases divided into four types BPPV (PC-BPP, AC-BPPV, HC-BPPV, MC-BPPV) were 36.45%, 22.78%, 28.57%, 63.16% respectively in our study .The differences among the four groups were statistically significant( < 0.05).That were higher in these cases with PC-BPPV or MC-BPPV than those with AC-BPPV or HC-BPPV.The HADS aggregate scores of the pre-repositioning were statistically significant( < 0.05). And the patients with PC-BPPV or MC-BPPV were higher than the other two groups.The HADS aggregate scores of the post-repositioning were statistically significant( <0.05). And the cases with PC-BPPV or MC-BPPV were higher than the other two groups. The post-repositioning scores were compared with the pre-repositioning scores, and the difference was significant( < 0.05). Among all cases with the four different types of BPPV,anxiety and depression psychological mood is more common in patients with PC-BPPV or MC-BPPV.Mood disorders affect the reset recovery after treatment,and reduce the therapeutic effect.We should pay more attention to psychological state of the patients with BPPV during treatment.And early psychological intervention can improve treatment effect.</td>

Four DHI scores were used including the total score (DHIT), the functional score (DHIF), the emotional score (DHIE), and the physical score (DHIP). We compared the pre-repositioning DHI scores and post-repositioning scores of patients, and also compared the DHI scores of patients with and without residual dizziness.  All of the 72 patients were underwent maneuver repositioning and recorded the DHI scores. The mean post-repositioning scores were dramatically decreased compared with pre-repositioning scores, and the difference was significant ( <0.01). The differences of the DHIP scores between the residual dizziness group and the non-residual dizziness group was not significant, while the DHIF scores, the DHIE scores and the DHIT scores between the two groups were statistically different.

	<td>The objective was to evaluate the clinical value of repositioning chairs in management of refractory benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and to study how different BPPV subtypes respond to treatment. We performed a retrospective chart review of 150 consecutive cases with refractory vertigo referred to our clinic within a 10-month period. The BPPV patients were managed with classical manual manoeuvres, the Epley Omniax(®) rotator (EO) or the TRV chair (TRV). In addition, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed. BPPV was identified in 95 cases. The number of needed treatments for posterior canalolithiasis versus posterior cupulolithiasis, horizontal cupulolithiasis and multi-canal affection was significant (p < 0.01). Thirty-seven (38 %) patients required only one repositioning manoeuvre and the overall symptom relief was 91.7-100 % after 3 treatments. Eleven patients (12 %) experienced relapse within the ½-year follow-up period. Horizontal cupulolithiasis and multi-canal affection constituted the most resilient cases. The literature search identified 9 repositioning chair studies. The EO and the TRV are highly valuable assets in diagnosis and management of BPPV of particularly complex and refractory cases. However, further validation is anticipated through controlled clinical trials.</td>

	<td>It is well-known that ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs) predominantly reflect utricular function whilst cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) reflect saccular function. To date, there are no published reports on the systemic evaluation of utricular and saccular function in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), nor are there any reports on the differences in VEMPs between patients with recurrent and non-recurrent BPPV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in cervical and ocular (c/o)VEMPs between patients with BPPV and normal controls, as well as between patients with recurrent and non-recurrent BPPV. Thirty patients with posterior canal BPPV and 30 healthy subjects (as normal controls) were prospectively enrolled. cVEMP and oVEMP testing using 500 Hz tone-burst stimuli were performed on all. VEMP tests were repeated 3 times on each subject to ensure reliability and reproducibility of responses. VEMPs were defined as present or absent. Abnormal VEMP was defined by lack of VEMP response. In the control group, abnormal cVEMPs responses were detected in 6.67% and abnormal oVEMPs responses were detected in 3.34%. In BPPV patients (10 with recurrent BPPV, 20 with non-recurrent BPPV), abnormal cVEMPs responses were detected in 30% and abnormal oVEMPs responses were detected in 56.7%. More patients with BPPV showed abnormal responses in c/oVEMPs as compared to the control group (p < 0.05). oVEMPs was more often abnormal as compared to cVEMPs in BPPV patients (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between abnormal cVEMP responses in non-recurrent BPPV patients (25%) and recurrent BPPV patients (40%) (p > 0.05). Differences in abnormal oVEMP responses (non-recurrent BPPV, 40%; recurrent BPPV, 90%) were significant (p < 0.05). An increased occurrence of abnormal c/oVEMP recordings appeared in BPPV patients, possibly as a result of degeneration of the otolith macula. oVEMPs were more often abnormal in BPPV patients as compared to cVEMPs, suggesting that utricular dysfunction may be more common than saccular dysfunction. Furthermore, oVEMP abnormalities in the recurrent BPPV group were significantly higher than those in the non-recurrent BPPV group. Assessment of c/oVEMPs in BPPV patients may therefore be of prognostic value in predicting likelihood of BPPV recurrence.</td>

A repositioning of otoconia to the utricle may occur during the repositioning maneuver in BPPV, an increasing oVEMP amplitudes was found after the repositioning maneuver, oVEMP examinations could be useful to evaluate the the effect of repositioning in BPPV.</td>

	<td>To explore the role of video nystagmography in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.   Eleven patients of 313 patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo had been diagnosed as multiple benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.They were post and horizontal semicircular canal ipsilaterally, bilateral post semicircular canal, superior and horizontal semicircular canal ipsilaterally, and bilateral superior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The patients were performed Dix-Hallpike test and Roll test under VNG, combined with track record by video nystagmography to confirm the affected sites. Six cases were post and horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ipsilaterally. Three cases were bilateral posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, one case of superior semicircular canal and horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ipsilaterally, and one case of bilateral superior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The symptom of patients got relief after repositioning sequentially. We repositioned the affected canal with strong nystagmus and vertigo at the first time.  Multiple benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was rare and easily misdiagnosed because of complex nystagmus. We can confirm the affected canal and intensity by video nystagmography and get good prognosis after repositioning sequentially.</td>

All patients were diagnosed by the Dix-Hallpike test or roll test and treated with the canalith repositioning procedure. The outcomes were compared among the three groups.   Unilateral semicircular canal BPPV was more than bilateral BPPV, the posterior semicircular canal was the most common canal involved, and multiple semicircular canal BPPV with Meniere' s disease patients needed repeated canalith repositioning procedure and had a higher recurrence rate. A lower success rate of treatment and a higher recurrence rate was found in BPPV patients with Meniere' s disease compared with those without Meniere' s disease .

	<td>Vestibular neuritis is one of the most common peripheral causes of acute vestibular syndrome, of which the diagnosis is generally based on a comprehensive interpretation of clinical and laboratory findings following reasonable exclusion of other disorders. This study aimed to investigate the final diagnosis of patients admitted to hospital under the clinical impression of vestibular neuritis who showed no unilateral caloric paresis. Forty-five patients who visited the emergency department with isolated acute spontaneous vertigo were included. Among them, six patients (13%) developed definitive spontaneous vertigo lasting longer than 20min again after discharge from hospital, accompanied by hearing loss, which was audiometrically documented, leading to a final diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease. Nine patients (20%) revisited our clinic with recurrent episodic vertigo without any documented hearing loss or auditory symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus or ear fullness, which led to a final diagnosis of possible Ménière's disease. In four patients (9%), initial spontaneous vertigo and nystagmus changed to positional vertigo and nystagmus on the second hospital day. In 26 patients (58%), neither another episode of vertigo nor auditory symptoms developed during follow-up period (7-92months), a condition to which the authors gave an arbitrary diagnosis of "mild unilateral vestibular deficit". In conclusion, patients admitted to hospital under clinical impression of vestibular neuritis may have various final diagnoses, and "mild unilateral vestibular deficit" was the most common final diagnosis among patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria of vestibular neuritis.</td>

	<td>The purpose of this article is to review relevant literature on the effect of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and blast injury on the vestibular system. Dizziness and imbalance are common sequelae associated with mTBI, and in some individuals, these symptoms may last for six months or longer. In war-related injuries, mTBI is often associated with blast exposure. The causes of dizziness or imbalance following mTBI and blast injuries have been linked to white matter abnormalities, diffuse axonal injury in the brain, and central and peripheral vestibular system damage. There is some evidence that the otolith organs may be more vulnerable to damage from blast exposure or mTBI than the horizontal semicircular canals. In addition, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder following head injury that is treated effectively with canalith repositioning therapy. Treatment for (non-BPPV) mTBI-related vestibular dysfunction has focused on the use of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) augmented with additional rehabilitation methods and medication. New treatment approaches may be necessary for effective otolith organ pathway recovery in addition to traditional VR for horizontal semicircular canal (vestibulo-ocular reflex) recovery.</td>

The clinic protocol includes a 2-week follow-up visit to determine the treatment outcome of the canalith repositioning treatment (CRT). To date, the characteristics of BPPV and treatment efficacy have not been reported in a cohort of veterans with BPPV. To determine the prevalence and characteristics of veterans diagnosed with BPPV in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center Audiology Clinic and to examine treatment outcomes. Retrospective chart review. A total of 102 veterans who tested positive for BPPV in the Vestibular Clinic at the Mountain Home VA Medical Center from March 2010 to August 2011. In 102 veterans who were diagnosed with BPPV, the posterior semicircular canal was most often involved (75%), motion-provoked vertigo was the most common symptom (84%), and the majority (43%) were diagnosed with BPPV in their sixth decade. The prevalence of BPPV in the Audiology Vestibular Clinic was 15.6%. Forty-one percent of veterans reported a symptom onset within 12 months of treatment for BPPV; however, 36% reported their symptoms began > 36 months prior to treatment. CRT was effective (negative Dix-Hallpike/roll test) in most veterans (86%) following 1 treatment appointment (M = 1.6), but more than half reported incomplete symptom resolution (residual dizziness) at the follow-up appointment. Eighteen percent of veterans experienced a recurrence (M = 1.8 years; SD = 1.7 years). The characteristics and treatment outcomes of BPPV in our veteran cohort was similar to what has been reported in the general population. Future work should focus on improving the timeliness of evaluation and treatment of BPPV and examining the time course and management of residual dizziness.</td>

A series of consecutive patients that fulfilled the Moll and Wright criteria for PsA and matched controls were studied. The study was performed at the Otolaryngology Division of a tertiary reference center. Vestibular evaluation including CTSIB followed by CDP was performed to all patients and age, sex, and ethnically frequency-matched controls. Patterns of CTSIB and CDP (gold standard) were assessed and compared. Sixty PsA patients (63.3% women) and 60 matched controls. PsA patients had higher frequency of abnormal oculocephalic response (13.3%) and abnormal caloric test (26.7%) than controls (0% in both cases) (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001, respectively). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was diagnosed in two (3.4%) patients and none of the controls (p = 1). Significantly increased frequency of abnormal CTSIB test with vestibular loss pattern (33.3%) in patients compared with controls (6%) was observed (p = 0.002). Significantly increased frequency of abnormal CDP was also observed in PsA patients (14 [23.3%] versus 0 [0%] of controls) (p < 0.001). CTSIB yielded 100% sensitivity, 73% specificity, 48% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. This study indicates that oculographic findings are common in PsA. CTSIB is useful for assessing balance disorder screening in the routine clinical practice in these patients.</td>

	<td>Various types of vestibular rehabilitation therapy are routinely used in clinical practice to treat unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation interventions (adaptation, substitution and habituation) in people with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction, exclusionary of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Meniere's disease. A search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were 1) a randomized controlled trial or randomized clinical trial; 2) written in English; 3) of participants with a unilateral, peripheral vestibular hypofunction; 4) of a conservative treatment approach only; and 5) with human subjects. Quality was assessed by two authors using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Effect size was calculated to determine the effect of treatment within each study group. Seven papers were selected for inclusion. Physiotherapy Evidence Database scores ranged from 2/10 to 7/10. Interventions within the selected studies included combinations of adaptation, habituation, substitution or substitution by itself. Calculated effect sizes, or significance values, revealed that all interventions demonstrated effectiveness. Two studies reported improvements on the dynamic gait index, and a large difference was seen between intervention groups of the two studies. Results suggest that vestibular therapy for unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction is effective. When considering all seven studies included in the review, it is difficult to determine the superiority of one intervention over another in treating unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction except when patient outcomes are captured by the dynamic gait index or dizziness handicap inventory. Many studies in this review demonstrate notable biases, suggesting that results should be used with caution. Future research should aim to use a common set of measures to capture outcomes.

Data of a complete otolaryngological, audiological, neurotologic, and imaging evaluation were available for all patients. Three hundred and twenty patients with idiopathic BPPV were used as a control group. The patients with BPPV secondary to mild head trauma presented the following features, in which they differed from the patients with idiopathic BPPV: (1) lower mean age, with more intense symptoms; (2) increased rate of horizontal and anterior semicircular canal involvement and frequent multiple canal and bilateral involvement; (3) greater incidence of canal paresis and presence of spontaneous nystagmus; (4) poorer treatment results, attributed mainly to coexisting canal paresis in many patients, and higher rate of recurrence. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo associated with mild head trauma differs from idiopathic BPPV in terms of several epidemiological and clinical features; it responds less effectively to treatment and is prone to recurrence.</td>

	<td>Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.</td>

	<td>The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the "Clinical Practice Guideline: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Update)." To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing, and increasing the appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.</td>

	<td>The objective of this article is to systematically review the evidence on the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Relevant published studies about VR in BPPV were searched in PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid using various keywords. We included trials that were available in the English language and did not apply publication year or publication status restrictions. Studies based on the VR in other peripheral and/or central balance disorders are excluded. Primary outcome was the effect on vertigo attacks and balance. Of 42 identified trials, only 12 trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Three of them investigated the role of VR in patients with BPPV comparing with no treatment, two of them evaluated the efficacy of VR versus medications, seven of them have highlighted the benefits of the VR alone or in combination with canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) compared to CRP alone. The studies differed in type of intervention, type of outcome and follow-up time. VR improves balance control, promoting visual stabilization with head movements, improving vestibular-visual interaction during head movement and expanding static and dynamic posture stability. CRP and VR seem to have a synergic effect in patients with BPPV, especially in elderly patients. VR does not reduce the recurrence rate, but it seems to reduce the unpleasantness. So VR can substitute CRP when spine comorbidities contraindicate CRP and can reduce the uptake of anti-vertigo drugs post CRP. Further studies are needed to confirm these encouraging results.</td>

	<td>A 33-year-old male professional football player suffered from acute-onset dizziness following a lower limb soft tissue treatment in prone lying. Symptoms included spinning vertigo lasting for 30's, headache, visual vertigo and disorientation. Clinical examination of balance and vestibular systems confirmed a left posterior canalithiasis benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and excluded other central and peripheral causes of dizziness. Two cycles of a left Epley manoeuvre were performed. An Epley manoeuvre abolished the BPPV and negated the need for medication. The player was able to return to play without dizziness within 24 hours completely symptom free. BPPV can be successfully identified and treated in elite football players and they can see a return to training and games within 24 hours.

Diagnoses, treatments and patient satisfaction were studied, with an analysis of the impact of medication management (stopping or starting medicines) on patients and service. In 12 months, 413 new patients with dizziness and balance disorders had appointments. The most common diagnoses were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular migraine. Eighty-four per cent of patients required self-management strategies, 50 per cent exercise therapy, 48 per cent medication management and 24 per cent a particle repositioning manoeuvre. Patient satisfaction was high (99 per cent). Having an independent prescriber physiotherapist leading the balance clinic has reduced the number of hospital visits and onward referrals. Nearly half of all patients required medication management as part of their dizziness or balance treatment.</td>

Epidemiologic characteristics, the results of audio-vestibular testing, and MRI findings were retrospectively analyzed. The most common findings were white matter hyperintensities (70.0%), sinusitis (34.2%), and brain atrophy (25.0%). There were no significant differences in MRI findings or epidemiologic characteristics according to BPPV subtype (p>0.05). A multiple regression analysis revealed that BPPV recurrence (odds ratio, 6.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-34.48; p=0.009) and brain atrophy (odds ratio, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-21.28; p=0.036) were positively associated with dizziness lasting longer than 3months. Brain atrophy was independently associated with long-lasting dizziness after BPPV.

This large population-based study demonstrated that patients with osteoporosis had a 1.82-fold higher risk of developing BPPV than those without osteoporosis through the use of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most frequent causes of vertigo. Osteoporosis reflects a homeostatic imbalance in the rate of bone turnover, with the rate of bone resorption exceeding that of bone formation. Recent evidence has indicated that osteoporosis is a risk factor for BPPV. We aimed to validate the risk of BPPV in osteoporotic patients through a nationwide, population-based, cohort study. Patients treated for osteoporosis were identified from entries made in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 2000 and 2013. Each osteoporosis patient was age- and sex-matched with four randomly selected subjects without osteoporosis. We compared the incidence rates of BPPV in the two cohorts (with and without osteoporosis) and identified risk factors. We identified 6649 osteoporosis patients and 26,596 match controls. According to the incidence of BPPV among the two groups, patients with osteoporosis were found to have a 1.82-fold higher risk of developing BPPV than those without osteoporosis. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between osteoporotic patients and the control cohort was 2.0 (p < 0.001). This large population-based study demonstrated that patients with osteoporosis were associated with an increased risk for BPPV. The results of this study provide some insight into the management of BPPV.</td>

	<td>To evaluate the value of cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) as a prognostic factor for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We reviewed 65 patients with BPPV who underwent cVEMP. Patients were divided into two groups according to resistance to the repositioning maneuver. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed with age, gender, affected semicircular canal, affected side and cVEMP parameters to find the associated factors for resistance to the repositioning maneuver. From univariable analysis, cVEMP interaural amplitude difference (IAD) ratio, the affected semicircular canal and the affected side showed a better association (p<0.10) with resistance to the repositioning maneuver. With multivariable analysis, decreased cVEMP IAD ratio at the affected side (⩽-25%) (p=0.043, OR=4.934) and the posterior semicircular canal (p=0.049, OR=3.780) remained as associated factors. Decreased cVEMP IAD ratio at the affected side is associated with resistance to the repositioning maneuver. BPPV patients with decreased cVEMP IAD ratio at the affected side have a higher likelihood of their BPPV persisting after a single repositioning maneuver. cVEMP test may provide a prognosis of BPPV. A decreased cVEMP IAD ratio at the affected side may be prognostic of BPPV not resolving after a single repositioning maneuver.</td>

	<td>The aim of this review was to analyze the existing literature concerning the relationship between Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and vestibular dysfunction. We used electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) to search and collect all published articles about the association between HT and vestibular disorders. Several observational and retrospective studies have postulated a relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and vestibular disorders. In most cases, an appropriate control group was lacking, and the impact of thyroid functional status could not precisely be established. In recent years, two well-designed prospective studies have provided convincing evidence that the association is not random. One article reported that patients with Ménière disease (MD) had a significantly higher prevalence of positive anti-thyroid autoantibody as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, more than half of MD patients had either positive anti-thyroid or non-organ-specific autoantibody titers, compared to less than 30% of both patients with unilateral vestibular paresis without cochlear involvement and healthy controls. Another study found that patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) had significantly higher serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and antithyroid autoantibody levels than healthy controls. Additionally, almost one-fifth of euthyroid patients with HT had signs of BPPV. The published results indicate that patients with MD or BPPV are potential candidates to also develop HT. Thus, in HT patients, the presence of even slight symptoms or signs potentially related to vestibular lesions should be carefully investigated. AITD = autoimmune thyroid disease; BPPV = benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; EH = endolymphatic hydrops; HT = Hashimoto thyroiditis; L-T  = L-thyroxine; MD = Ménière disease; PS = Pendred syndrome; Tg = thyroglobulin; TPO = thyroid peroxidase; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.</td>

	<td>Although recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have contributed to the detection of tiny lesions in the internal auditory canal (IAC) that may be responsible for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), there have been relatively few studies on the clinical characteristics of intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage (ILH) and labyrinthitis versus those regarding IAC tumors. Our purpose was to investigate the frequency of those IAC lesions on MRI and their clinical characteristics. Initial MRIs of 200 patients with SSNHL (93 men, 107 women; mean age = 48.61 years, range: 18-84 years), as well as detailed clinical histories, audiological examinations, and thyroid function, lipid battery, and serological tests (for viral agents and autoimmune disease), were performed. All patients were hospitalized at the time of diagnosis of SSNHL and were administered the same treatment protocol. Patients were divided into idiopathic and secondary groups according to their MRI results. After discharge, they underwent follow-up audiometry and clinical examination at predetermined intervals (2 weeks, 1, 2, 4, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years). Propensity score-matching and receiver operating characteristics curves of the initial parameters were used for estimating clinical characteristics. Of the 200 patients, 25 (12.55%) who had abnormal findings suggesting inner ear lesions on MRI were assigned to the secondary SSNHL group; within this group, 10 patients (10/200, 5%) had a tumor invading the IAC, 7 (7/200, 3.5%) had ILH, 6 (6/200, 3%) had labyrinthitis, and 2 (1%) had a structural deformity of the IAC. The secondary group showed significantly poor recovery of hearing function compared with that in the idiopathic group. Patients with ILH or labyrinthitis showed prognoses that were equally poor as those of patients with tumors in the secondary group. Additionally, patients with such lesions showed significant canal paresis on the lesion side at an early stage and a high prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In conclusion, the prevalence of non-tumorous lesions on MRI represents common findings and showed a poorer treatment response than that of vestibular Schwannoma in patients with SSNHL. Abnormal canal paresis (cut-off value of 35% on the lesioned side, sensitivity 65.2% and specificity 67%), spontaneous nystagmus directed to the contralesional side, and positional vertigo would be the clinical presentation of SSNHL with IAC lesions, in which the presence of acute prolonged vertigo or positional vertigo compatible with BPPV suggests the possibility of a non-tumorous lesion, such as ILH or a labyrinthitis rather than an IAC tumor.</td>

	<td>Positional nystagmus is usually caused by peripheral vestibular disorder, mostly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, positional nystagmus is also encountered in central lesions. We aimed to determine clinical characteristics of the structures responsible for central positional nystagmus (CPN) associated with brain tumors. All four patients (3 men; range=19-77years) had an evaluation of spontaneous and positional nystagmus using video-oculography. Brain MRIs were performed in all patients. All patients showed apogeotropic positional nystagmus during supine roll tests, and had an initial diagnosis of BPPV. Except for the positional nystagmus, findings of neurological examination were normal. Because all subjects were initially diagnosed with BPPV, canalith repositioning maneuvers were applied repeatedly but without a success. Brain MRI finally disclosed brain tumors involving the midline cerebellar structures around the fourth ventricle and the nodulus. The pathological diagnosis was hemangioblastoma in two and metastatic tumor in the others. An apogeotropic type of CPN may be an isolated finding in patients with a cerebellar tumor. Even in patients with isolated apogeotropic positional nystagmus, a central lesion should be sought especially when refractory to repeated canalith repositioning maneuvers.</td>

	<td> Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a generally benign condition that responds to repositioning maneuvers and frequently resolves spontaneously. However, for some patients it can become a disabling condition in which surgery must be considered. Two different surgical techniques exist, singular neurectomy and posterior semicircular canal occlusion.   The objective of this study is to review the current status of singular nerve section and posterior semicircular canal occlusion as treatments for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and to determine if there are published data available that favors one over the other.   MEDLINE and OLDMEDLINE databases of the National Library of Medicine.   Four studies regarding singular neurectomy and 14 reports on semicircular canal occlusion were analyzed. Both techniques are reported to provide similar symptomatic benefit, with low risk of hearing loss and balance impairment. However, anatomical and clinical studies of singular neurectomy show it to be a more challenging technique, and considering that it is indicated in a very small number of cases, it may be difficult to master.   Both singular neurectomy and semicircular canal occlusion can be safe and effective in those few patients that require surgery for intractable positional vertigo. Although semicircular canal occlusion requires a postauricular transmastoid approach, it is ultimately easier to learn and perform adequately, and thus may be considered the best alternative.</td>

A 2 year retrospective study of the hospital records from September 2014 to August 2016 was done to study the causes of dizziness and the limitations and challenges in the diagnosis. 75 complete records of patients presenting with dizziness were accessed and analysed. 54.7% of the patients were males and most patients were young adults. Most of the cases were benign and Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was the commonest diagnosed case (20%). Potentially life threatening cases diagnosed were cerebellar infarct and posterior fossa space occupying lesion (5.3%). Complete evaluation of a dizzy patient must be done to arrive at a causal diagnosis. Injudicious use of vestibular sedatives should be discouraged. Proper training and education to the primary care physician should be imparted so that they can adopt a practical approach for evaluation and management of a dizzy person.</td>

	<td>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a health and socioeconomic concern worldwide. In patients with TBI, post-traumatic balance problems are often the result of damage to the vestibular system. Nystagmus is common in these patients, and can provide insight into the damage that has resulted from the trauma. To present a systematic overview of published literature regarding nystagmus in patients with TBI. Nine databases and platforms were searched during October 2016 for articles published between 1996 and 2016. Studies of any research design and published in English that focused on nystagmus in patients with TBI were considered for inclusion. A total of 110 articles were screened once duplicates had been removed, and 29 full-text articles were assessed. Eleven articles were included in the quality appraisal phase (using the McMaster tool), after which 10 articles were included in this review. This review describes nystagmus in 713 patients, and all articles reviewed described the type of assessment method that was used. However, the results lacked comprehensive data regarding the assessment, measurement and description of nystagmus in TBI patients, or the possible link and relationship between nystagmus and TBI. This systematic review indicated that: (i) there is a growing body of evidence that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo should be considered during the medical examination of all patients suffering from head trauma; (ii) all patients with TBI should undergo visual (eye movement) and vestibular examination; and (iii) future studies should include quantitative measurements of eye movements and nystagmus.</td>

	<td>The Le Fort I osteotomy is widely used to correct dentofacial deformities. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular end organ disorder characterized by short, often recurrent episodes of vertigo. Head trauma is one of the known causes of BPPV. During pterygoid osteotomy, the surgical trauma induced by percussion with the surgical mallet and osteotomes can displace otoliths into the semicircular canal, resulting in BPPV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential risk of occurrence of BPPV in individuals undergoing Le Fort I osteotomy. Twenty-three patients were included in this study. The Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre, positional tests using electronystagmography, and vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) tests were performed 1 week before surgery (T0), 1 week after surgery (T1), and 1 month after surgery (T2). The results were compared statistically. BPPV was observed in three patients. Eleven patients had nystagmus at the T1 evaluation and seven at the T2 evaluation. The difference between the T0 and T1 time points was statistically significant (P=0.001). BPPV is a possible complication of Le Fort I osteotomy. Surgeons should be aware of this complication, and the diagnosis of BPPV should be considered in patients who have undergone Le Fort I osteotomy.</td>

	<td>Ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) and cervical VEMP (cVEMP) are newer diagnostic methods, which allow an insight into the otolith senses. Our aim was to determine changes in certain parameters of the VEMP wave complex after successfully performed repositioning procedure, as an indicator of the state of recovery in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This may confirm the theory of otolith returning into the area of otolithic senses. The study included 48 patients with unilateral posterior semicircular canal BPPV. On their first arrival, otoneurological examinations, oVEMP and cVEMP tests were performed. The same were included in follow up check-ups scheduled at seven days and six months after successful implementation of Epley maneuvers. The initial measurement revealed a significantly reduced amplitude of oVEMP on the affected side. On the 7-day measurement, the amplitude increase was observed on the affected side, with significant reduction in the amplitude ratio (p=0.693), which reached statistical significance on the last measurement at 6 months (p=0.006). These findings confirmed the hypothesis of the return of otoconia into the utricular area.</td>

	<td>Balance is achieved and maintained by a balance system called a labyrinth that is composed of three semicircular canals and the otolith organs that sense linear gravity and acceleration. Within each semicircular canal, there is a gelatinous structure called the cupula, which is deformed under the influence of the surrounding endolymph. One of the balance disorders is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and one of the pathological conditions that have been identified as possible causes of this syndrome is canalithiasis-disturbance of the endolymph flow and cupular displacement caused by the free-moving otoconia particles within the lumen of the canal. Analysis of phenomena occurring within the semicircular canal can help to explain some balance-related disorders and the response of the vestibular system to external perturbations under various pathological conditions. Numerical simulations allow a study of the influence of a wide range of factors, without the need to perform experiments and clinical examinations. In case of canalithiasis, an accurate explanation and tracking of the motion of otoconia particles in vivo is obviously nearly impossible. In this study, a numerical model was developed to predict the motion of otoconia particles within the semicircular canal and the effect of the endolymph flow and particles on the deformation of the cupula.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent type of vertigo. The treatment of canalithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal consists in performing a particle-repositioning maneuver, such as the Epley maneuver (EM). However, the EM is not effective in all cases. The objective of this study is to identify risk factors, which predict the EM failure, among the clinical variables recorded in anamnesis and patient examination. This is an observational prospective multicentric study. All patients presenting with BPPV were recruited and applied the EM and appointed for a follow-up visit 7 days later. The following variables were recorded: sex, age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, migraine, osteoporosis, diseases of the inner ear, previous ipsilateral BPPV, previous traumatic brain injury, previous sudden head deceleration, time of evolution, sulpiride or betahistine treatment, experienced symptoms, outcome of the Halmagyi maneuver, laterality, cephalic hyperextension of the neck, intensity of nystagmus, intensity of vertigo, duration of nystagmus, occurrence of orthotropic nystagmus, symptoms immediately after the EM, postural restrictions, and symptoms 7 days after the EM. Significant differences in the rate of loss of nystagmus were found for six variables: hyperlipidemia, previous ipsilateral BPPV, intensity of nystagmus, duration of nystagmus, post-maneuver sweating, and subjective status. The most useful significant variables in the clinical practice to predict the success of the EM are previous BPPV and intensity of nystagmus. In the other significant variables, no physiopathological hypothesis can be formulated or differences between groups are too small.</td>

Fifty participants, BPPV (n=34) and BPPV+DM (n=16) were examined for symptom severity (dizziness handicap inventory, DHI), mobility (functional gait assessment, FGA), and postural sway (using an accelerometer in five conditions) before and after the CRM. The number of maneuvers required for symptom resolution was recorded. At baseline, no differences in DHI or FGA scores were seen between groups, however, people with BPPV+DM had higher sway velocity in the medio-lateral direction in tandem stance (p<0.01). After treatment, both groups improved in DHI and FGA scores (p<0.01), with no differences between groups. Decrease in sway velocity in the mediolateral direction (p=0.003) were seen in tandem stance in persons with BPPV+DM. There were no differences between the groups in the number of CRMs provided. This pilot study showed no differences in symptom severity, mobility deficits or efficacy of CRM treatments in people with posterior canal BPPV canalithiasis with and without DM.

The present study consists of 207 patients ranging in age from 16 to 70 (52.67±10.67). We conducted the same maneuvers sequentially one more time in patients with negative results. We detected patients who had negative results in first maneuver and later developed symptom and nystagmus. We evaluated post-treatment success and patient satisfaction by performing Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) at first admittance and two weeks after treatment in all patients with BPPV. Of a total of 207 patients, we diagnosed 139 in first maneuver. We diagnosed 28 more patients in sequentially performed maneuvers. The remaining 40 patients were referred to imaging. There was a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment DHI scores in patients with BPPV (p<0.001). Performing the diagnostic maneuvers only one more time in vertigo patients in the first clinical evaluation increases the diagnosis success in BPPV.

The video head impulse test (vHIT) is a new test that examines the function of the canals. This study aimed to investigate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain, gain asymmetry and saccades after stimulating all six canals in patients definitively diagnosed with posterior semicircular canal BPPV (PSC-BPPV). Twenty-nine unilateral PSC-BPPV patients with normal oculographic and caloric results were enrolled in this study. vHIT was performed on six canals, and VOR gain, gain asymmetry and saccades were measured. Sixteen (55.17%) patients had abnormal posterior canal VOR gains in the ipsilesional ear. VOR gains in both horizontal canals were within normal limits. Superior canal VOR gains were mostly lower than normal and were not correlated to PSC abnormalities (P>0.05). No corrective saccades could be observed. VOR gain in the direction of the posterior semicircular canal may be reduced in PSC-BPPV patients. Evaluation of PSC-VOR parameters could be beneficial, although superior canal measurements should be interpreted with caution.</td>

	<td>To systematically review the evidence and make recommendations with regard to diagnostic utility of cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP and oVEMP, respectively). Four questions were asked: Does cVEMP accurately identify superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS)? Does oVEMP accurately identify SCDS? For suspected vestibular symptoms, does cVEMP/oVEMP accurately identify vestibular dysfunction related to the saccule/utricle? For vestibular symptoms, does cVEMP/oVEMP accurately and substantively aid diagnosis of any specific vestibular disorder besides SCDS? The guideline panel identified and classified relevant published studies (January 1980-December 2016) according to the 2004 American Academy of Neurology process. Level C positive: Clinicians may use cVEMP stimulus threshold values to distinguish SCDS from controls (2 Class III studies) (sensitivity 86%-91%, specificity 90%-96%). Corrected cVEMP amplitude may be used to distinguish SCDS from controls (2 Class III studies) (sensitivity 100%, specificity 93%). Clinicians may use oVEMP amplitude to distinguish SCDS from normal controls (3 Class III studies) (sensitivity 77%-100%, specificity 98%-100%). oVEMP threshold may be used to aid in distinguishing SCDS from controls (3 Class III studies) (sensitivity 70%-100%, specificity 77%-100%). Level U: Evidence is insufficient to determine whether cVEMP and oVEMP can accurately identify vestibular function specifically related to the saccule/utricle, or whether cVEMP or oVEMP is useful in diagnosing vestibular neuritis or Ménière disease. Level C negative: It has not been demonstrated that cVEMP substantively aids in diagnosing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or that cVEMP or oVEMP aids in diagnosing/managing vestibular migraine.</td>

	<td>This article summarizes an approach to evaluating dizziness for the general neurologist and reviews common and important causes of dizziness and vertigo. Improved methods of diagnosing patients with vertigo and dizziness have been evolving, including additional diagnostic criteria and characterization of some common conditions that cause dizziness (eg, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness). Other uncommon causes of dizziness (eg, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, episodic ataxia type 2) have also been better clarified. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes of vertigo can be accomplished reliably through history and examination, but imaging techniques have further added to accuracy. What has not changed is the necessity of obtaining a basic history of the patient's symptoms to narrow the list of possible causes. Dizziness and vertigo are extremely common symptoms that also affect function at home and at work. Improvements in the diagnosis and management of the syndromes that cause dizziness and vertigo will enhance patient care and cost efficiencies in a health care system with limited resources. Clinicians who evaluate patients with dizziness will serve their patient population well by continuing to manage patients with well-focused workup and attentive care.</td>

	<td>The benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a vestibular disorder cause of vertigo. The BPPV may be corrected mechanically by repositioning maneuvers but even after successful maneuvers, some patients report residual dizziness for a certain period afterward. Early recognition and treatment might decrease the incidence of residual dizziness in patients with BPPV, especially in those patients with psychiatric comorbidities and in the elderly, lowering the risk of falling. Many pathogenetic hypotheses for residual dizziness are under debate. The purpose of this review was to identify, evaluate and review recent researches about possible causal factors involved in residual dizziness and the implications on clinical practice. A literature search was performed using different databases such as Pubmed and Scopus. The following search terms were used:   The search found a total of 1192 titles, which were reduced to 963 after a procedure of de-duplication of the found titles. The research was then restricted to an interval of time comprised between 2000 and 2016 for a total of 800 titles. Among these titles, only those including the terms   were considered eligible for this review. Only publications in English language were taken into consideration and we excluded those with not available abstract. Finally, 90 abstracts were obtained and critically evaluated by two different Authors, and additional studies were identified by hand searching from the references of artiche of interest. Only 53 were included in this work.</td>

	<td>Dizziness makes up a diagnostic and treatment challenge. The diagnostic accuracy of the medical history and vestibular physical examination in cases of vestibular symptoms is not clear. The aim of this study is to determine the association between vestibular physical examination, vestibular questionnaires, and electronystagmography (ENG) test in patients with vestibular symptoms. This is a prospective study of 135 adults with vestibular symptoms. The subjects underwent targeted physical examination and filled vestibular questionnaires, including the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), before ENG testing. The results of the physical examination and questionnaires were compared with the final ENG findings. Of patients who had normal ENG results, 32.1% (17/52) showed abnormal physical examination, and 48.8% (40/82) of the patient who had normal physical examination showed abnormal ENG results ( P = .46). Among patients with severe disability by DHI, 46.4% (13/28) had an abnormal ENG, and 42.9% (12/28) had a normal ENG ( P = .39). This study did not demonstrate association between vestibular physical examination, vestibular questionnaires, and ENG results. Although history (augmented by questionnaires) and physical examination are the initial steps in the evaluation of vertigo, the current study suggests that they should be complemented by objective testing for evaluation of inner ear origin of vertigo.</td>

	<td>Elevated Motion Sickness Susceptibility (MSS) in Meniere?s disease (MD) is likely to be a consequence of the onset of MD and not migraine per se. Pathologies of the vestibular system influence MSS. Bilateral vestibular deficits lower MSS, vestibular neuritis or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo have little overall effect, whereas vestibular migraine elevates MSS. However, less is known about MSS in MD, a condition in which many patients experience vestibular loss and migraine symptoms. The authors conducted an online survey that posed diagnostic and disease questions before addressing frequency of headaches, migraines, visual display dizziness (VDD), syncope, social life, and work impact of dizziness (SWID4) and motion sickness susceptibility (MSSQ). The two groups were: diagnosed MD individuals with hearing loss (n = 751) and non-MD individuals in the control group (n = 400). The MD group showed significantly elevated MSS, more headache and migraine, increased VDD, higher SWID4 scores, and increased syncope. MSS was higher in MD than controls only after the development of MD, but not before, nor in childhood. Although elevated in MD compared with controls, MSS was lower than migraine patients from past data. Multivariate analysis revealed VDD, SWID4, and MSS in adulthood as the strongest predictors of MD, but not headache nor migraine.</td>

The severity of the symptoms and the recurrence rate were compared between the two groups.  Compared with the control group, patients with vitamin D deficiency group showed severer symptoms, either in longer duration of vertigo, lower success rate of repositioning maneuver treatment at the first time, or higher recurrence rate within six months.  Serum 25-OHD level was negatively correlated with the severity and prognosis of BPPV, and could be used as an important index to evaluate the prognosis of BPPV.</td>

VOR gains two pairs of vertical semicircular canals, and the corresponding asymmetrical value of three VOR gains. The saccades information was also recorded.   Compared with the healthy control group and BPPV patients, the affected horizontal and vertical VOR gains were declined and the corresponding asymmetries were increased in VN patients (all  <0.01). BPPV group also showed higher vertical VOR gain asymmetries compared with the healthy control group (all  <0.01), but no significant difference was observed in VOR gains and horizontal VOR gain asymmetry (all  >0.05). The sensibility of vHIT in diagnosis of VN was 87.9%. Among 33 VN patients, 22 were diagnosed with superior vestibular nerve dysfunction, 7 were found with inferior vestibular nerve dysfunction and 3 were with both dysfunction; and 1 case was not distinguished.   Video head impulse test can quantitatively evaluate the vestibular dysfunction of VN and can help early diagnosis of VN, which may be widely used in clinic.</td>

	<td>The set of symptoms relating to disorders of the balance system are common in the general population. However, there are few studies quantifying the frequency of onset of the various vestibular disorders that present in specialist otoneurology units in the Spanish population. The aim of this study is to establish the epidemiology of vestibular disorders, their form of presentation, and the expected care burden in a specialist otoneurology clinic. A retrospective, descriptive, observational study of patients referred to the otoneurology unit of a third level hospital between 1/1/2015 and 31/12/2015. One hundred and seventy-four patients were assessed (121 women and 53 men) with a mean age of 53±17 years. Forty-three individuals per 100,000 inhabitants were assessed over the study period. The patients were referred in the majority from external ENT (36.8%) and primary care (28.7%) clinics. The most frequent reason for consultation was dizziness (40.2%) followed by vertigo (31%). The most frequent diagnoses were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (28.2%) and vestibular migraine (28.2%) -defined (59%) or probable (41%)-, followed by Ménière's disease (13.8%), vascular disorders (5.7%), chronic subjective dizziness (4.6%) and vestibular neuritis (4%). The availability of precise information on the prevalence and impact of vestibular disorders is important to enable the health services to plan an appropriate response to the expected care demand in the community. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular migraine are the most commonly diagnosed disorders in otoneurology clinics. Systematic terminology is essential for the comparison of results.</td>

	<td>Exposure to environmental chemicals has been suggested to alter the physiologic state of the inner and middle ear. However, it is unknown if particulate matter exposure is associated with acute vestibular dysfunction. To estimate the effects of particulate matter exposure on the number of hospital visits related to three major diseases of vestibular dysfunction, Meniere's disease (MD), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and vestibular neuronitis (VN). Our study subject is from Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, which is dynamic cohort consist of 1 million participants representing the Korean population. Among total cohort participants, we used the hospital visit data of 210,000 individuals who resided in Seoul from 2007 to 2010. Time series analysis using the Poisson generalized additive model and case-crossover analysis using conditional logistic regression were used to investigate the association between daily particulate matter levels (PM , particulate matter <2.5μg/m ; PM , particulate matter <10μg/m ; PM , PM - PM ) and number of MD, BPPV, and VN hospital visits. Time series analysis showed that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM  and PM  on lag day 1 was associated with an increased risk of MD hospital visits [relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), PM : 1.09 (1.02-1.15); PM : 1.06 (1.02-1.10)]. In addition, elderly individuals (≥60 years old) showed an increased risk of MD hospital visits after particulate matter exposure when compared to younger individuals. An IQR increase in particulate matter on lag day 1 was associated with a marginally significant increase in VN hospital visits [RR (95%CI), PM : 1.11 (0.98-1.25); PM : 1.07 (0.99-1.15); PM : 1.04 (0.99-1.09)]. However, no association between particulate matter exposure and BPPV hospital visits was noted. Case-crossover analyses showed similar results to the time-series analysis across all three diseases. MD hospital visits were associated with ambient particulate matter exposure. Elderly individuals, in particular, were more susceptible to particulate matter exposure than younger individuals.</td>

	<td>Cerebellar infarction is an uncommon but serious cause of isolated acute vestibular symptoms, particularly in young, healthy individuals, and can easily be overlooked. We present two cases of cerebellar infarction in U.S. Air Force pilots, one of which occurred during flight. A 41-yr-old man developed acute vertigo, disequilibrium, nausea, and headache, with progressive slow symptomatic improvement, and presented to medical attention 4 d after symptom onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed right inferomedial cerebellar infarction. Echocardiography discovered patent foramen ovale and atrial septal aneurysm. A 40-yr-old man developed severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting during initial aircraft descent. Head computed tomography scan was performed acutely and was normal. Initial assessment was benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Brain magnetic resonance imaging 1 mo after symptom onset showed a small right inferior cerebellar infarction. Patent foramen ovale and bilateral atrial enlargement were seen on echocardiography. Both pilots made full neurological recoveries and were eventually returned to flight status. Central causes of isolated acute vestibular symptoms are uncommon and are often not considered in otherwise healthy individuals. Cerebellar infarction is one of these uncommon but increasingly recognized causes of acute vestibular symptoms. As evaluation and management of central causes are much different from peripheral conditions, prompt localization confirmation is paramount. Accurate evidence-based bedside screening methods are available for rapid localization. Awareness of the possibility of central etiologies and careful clinical evaluation with application of bedside screening methods in patients with acute vestibular symptoms will reduce the number of inaccurate diagnoses.Hesselbrock RR.

	<td>Ménière's disease is an inner ear disorder characterized by vertigo attacks, fluctuating and progressive hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness in the affected ear. The pathophysiology of Ménière's disease remains elusive. Theories so far are anatomical variation in the size or position of the endolymphatic sac and duct, viral inflammation or autoimmune involvement of the sac, or a genetically determined abnormality of endolymph control. Animal studies on blocking the ductus reuniens and endolymphatic duct have produced hydrops in the cochlea, saccule, and utricle. Cone beam computed tomography images show a similar pattern with apparent obstruction of the ductus reuniens, saccular duct, and endolymphatic sinus. New studies documenting the age of onset of Ménière's disease show a pattern similar to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, raising the possibility that the fundamental cause of Ménière's disease might be detached saccular otoconia.</td>

	<td>To investigate the effectiveness of unilateral posterior semicircular canal (PSCC)-plugging surgery for patients with intractable bilateral PSCC-type benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (P-BPPV). From July 2011 to December 2015, we diagnosed 136 patients with P-BPPV. Of these, 3 patients had bilateral P-BPPV, and in 2 of the 3, the condition had been refractory to conservative treatment for more than 1 year. We planned a staged PSCC-plugging surgery for these 2 patients; initially one side was treated, and the contralateral side was treated 6 months later. After the first surgery, both patients experienced improvement in symptoms of vertigo and nystagmus on the operated side and no change on the non-operated side. Patients underwent the Epley maneuver for the non-operated side. In one case, the non-operated side was cured. In the other case, although the P-BPPV was not completely resolved, the patient was satisfied with the result of unilateral surgery because he was now able to turn in bed to the operated side without vertigo. Before surgery, he had experienced vertigo when turning even slightly in bed. We propose that even unilateral PSCC-plugging surgery is effective for some patients with intractable bilateral P-BPPV.</td>

	<td>Although several researchers have tried various canalith repositioning procedures for lateral canalolithiasis, a standard treatment has not been established. We adopt 120° rotation, which is anatomically appropriate because the principle of cure may be the fixing of pathological debris to the dark cells of the utricle. The aims of this study were to clarify the efficacy rate of the affected-ear-up 120° maneuver and to elucidate the appearance rate of lying-down nystagmus in patients with lateral canalolithiasis. The subjects were 31 patients (26 females, 5 males) who revealed transient direction-changing geotropic positional nystagmus. After determining the involved side, we performed the canalith repositioning procedure immediately. To perform this maneuver: (1) Place the patient in the supine position. (2) Rotate the head toward the healthy side until facing downward 120° from supine. (3) Sit up. (4) Ask the patient to remain upright with the chin down until going to bed. Twenty-nine patients (94%) became symptom free by only one maneuver. However, one patient converted to ipsilateral posterior cupulolithiasis, and another required a second maneuver. Lying-down nystagmus was found in 29 patients (94%), the transient type in 23 (74%), and the persistent type in 6 (19%). The direction of transient (not persistent) lying-down nystagmus was mostly toward the healthy side. These results suggest that the affected-ear-up 120° maneuver is effective and that lying-down nystagmus appears at a high rate.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is strongly related to sleep. This study proposes a micro-otoconia accumulation theory in which the pathological debris is an aggregate of micro-otoconia over a long time period, and which begins to slide by its own weight during sleep. To examine the onset time of idiopathic BPPV and to investigate its etiology. Patients (n = 351) were classified as posterior canalolithiasis (PC), horizontal canalolithiasis (HC), and horizontal heavy cupula (HHC) according to nystagmus findings. This study examined the medical records, and categorized the onset times into the following four groups; (1) during sleep, (2) at the time of rising, (3) morning, and (4) afternoon. PC (n = 135): In 33 patients, vertigo occurred during sleep, in 69 patients at rising, in 10 patients in the morning, and in 23 patients in the afternoon. HC (n = 87): In 38 patients, vertigo occurred during sleep, in 30 patients at rising, in eight patients in the morning, and in 11 patients in the afternoon.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) involving horizontal semicircular canal (HSCC) is characterized by direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN) in a supine roll test, and the occurrence of spontaneous nystagmus in HSCC BPPV has been reported recently. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus (PSN) in patients with HSCC canalolithiasis, and evaluate the effect of the presence of PSN on treatment outcome.Between April 2014 and January 2016, 75 and 59 patients with HSCC canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis, respectively, were enrolled. Spontaneous and positional nystagmus were examined.PSN was observed in 31 of 75 patients (41%) with HSCC canalolithiasis, and 55 of 59 patients (93%) with HSCC cupulolithiasis. PSN persisted during the period of observation, which was at least 1 minute in all patients with PSN. In HSCC canalolithiasis, direction-reversing nystagmus was observed in 58 patients (25 bilateral and 33 unilateral). Nine of 25 patients with bilateral direction-reversing nystagmus, and 22 of 33 patients with unilateral direction-reversing nystagmus showed PSN. None of 17 patients without direction-reversing nystagmus showed PSN. The direction of PSN corresponded to that of direction-reversing nystagmus in all 22 patients with unilateral direction-reversing nystagmus. The proportion of patients who recovered after 1 session of repositioning maneuver was not significantly different between patients with and without PSN (P = .867).PSN was observed more commonly in HSCC cupulolithiasis than canalolithiasis. The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying PSN can be explained by natural inclination of HSCC and medial to lateral orientation of the HSCC cupular axis in cupulolithiasis, and by spontaneous reversal of initial positional nystagmus (direction-reversing nystagmus) generated by short-term adaptation of vestibulo-ocular reflex in canalolithiasis. The presence of PSN in HSCC canalolithiasis may not affect the treatment outcome.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vertigo and the posterior and/or lateral semicircular canals are usually affected. BPPV is characterized by brief attacks of rotatory vertigo associated with positional and/or positioning nystagmus, which are elicited by specific head positions or changes in head position relative to gravity. In patients with the posterior-canal-type of BPPV, torsional nystagmus is induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. In patients with the lateral-canal-type of BPPV, horizontal geotropic or apogeotropic nystagmus is induced by the supine roll test. The pathophysiology of BPPV is canalolithiasis comprising free-floating otoconial debris within the endolymph of a semicircular canal, or cupulolithiasis comprising otoconial debris adherent to the cupula. The observation of positional and/or positioning nystagmus is essential for the diagnosis of BPPV. BPPV is treated with the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP). Through a series of head position changes, the CRP moves otoconial debris from the affected semicircular canal to the utricle. In this review, we provide the classification, diagnostic criteria, and examinations for the diagnosis, and specific and non-specific treatments of BPPV in accordance with the Japanese practical guidelines on BPPV published by the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research.</td>

This coincidence has been reported previously in the literature, and is reviewed here in terms of possible aetiology. A new hypothesis to account for both conditions is offered, implicating free-floating degenerating debris from the otolithic apparatus.

These were evaluated using the data collected. Clinic group: 90 patients; 37 male, 53 female. Age range 15-82 years. Normative group: Ninety subjects; 31 male, 59 female. Age range 21-79 years. PN was seen in 75.6% of the clinic group and in 50% of the normative group. The prevalence of nystagmus of slow phase velocity (SPV) > 3°/s was significantly higher in the clinic group than the normative group. The maximum SPV recorded in each position was greater from the clinic group than the normative group. This study supports the use of normative thresholds for SPV for both horizontal and vertical PN. A normative threshold of >3°/s for horizontal and >7°/s for vertical nystagmus is proposed.</td>

	<td> To analyze the objective characteristics of roll test and Dix-Hallpike test in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(BPPV)patients, discussing the premier solution of positional test.   A total of 230 patients with BPPV, whereas 170 posterior semicircular canal canalithiasis (PSC-Can) BPPV and 60 horizontal semicircular canal canalithiasis (HSC-Can) BPPV were involved respectively. The induced nystagmus in roll test and Dix-Hallpike test was recorded by video nystagmuo graph (VNG), and the direction, intensity and time characteristics of nystagmus were compared in various BPPV.SPSS19.0 software was used for statistical analysis.   Vertically upward nystagmus was induced by hanging in 170 PSC-Can Dix-Hallpike test, and the nystagmus reversed and turned weaker when the subjects came to sit. The intensity of nystagmus at turning to lesion side by hanging and sitting were (30.3±14.1)°/s and (12.6±7.5)°/s respectively, the difference was statistically significant ( =20.153,  <0.05). However, no nystagmus was induced in PSC-Can roll test. Horizontal nystagmus in the same direction with turning was induced in 60 HSC-Can roll test. The intensity of nystagmus at turning to lesion side and normal side was (42.0±18.0)°/s and (20.3±8.7)°/s respectively, the difference was statistically significant ( =12.731,  <0.05). Furthermore, horizontal nystagmus in the same direction with turning was induced in 57 HSC-Can Dix-Hallpike. The coherence was 95% with the results of roll test.   Dix-Hallpike test can not only be used to diagnose PSC-Can, but also induce nystagmus in HSC-Can effectively. Whereas the roll test only show significance in diagnosing HSC-Can. To avoid uncomfortable stimulation to patients as much as possible, we suggest to use Dix-Hallpike test at first, and to judge whether using roll test based on the result of the horizontal nystagmus.</td>

The significance and shortcomings of each step were analyzed by simulating and observing the Li's repositioning maneuver for horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. According to the model of semicircular canal, the otoliths of horizontal semicircular canal are more likely to return to the ampulla instead of moving into the utriculus through the semicircular canal after using Li's repositioning maneuver.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of dizziness in the elderly. This has been identified as a risk factor in falls. Falls are the leading cause of disability and the leading cause of death from injury among people over 75 in the UK. We assessed the effect of BPPV treatment on falls in an elderly population by retrospectively reviewing one unit's experience of BPPV management over an 8-year period from June 2008 to June 2016. We specifically assessed patients who were referred for the primary reason of falls and were aged over 65 years. These patients were evaluated and treated with particle repositioning maneuvers if their positional tests were positive. The frequency of falls prior to their visit and at 6-month clinic follow-up were reviewed. The total number of falls in the cohort reduced significantly ( P < .0001) after the procedure, from 128 to 46 falls (64% reduction). Associated comorbidities were also evaluated in this group. A prompt and effective treatment of BPPV is prudent to prevent devastating falls in older people in our communities.</td>

To identify the efficacy and safety of stapedotomy procedures performed with a nickel titanium prosthesis for patients with otosclerosis. A review of 431 unique stapedotomies performed over 14 years by a single surgeon at an academic tertiary care center yielded 312 cases with nickel titanium prosthesis that met inclusion criteria of otosclerosis diagnosis, initial surgery in operative ear, and presence of pre-operative and post-operative audiograms. Pure-tone averages (PTA) at baseline and 8 weeks after surgery were calculated over four frequencies; 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Average air-bone gaps (ABG) were calculated from pre-operative and post-operative audiograms. Average pre-operative baseline PTA was 56.7 dB in the affected ear. Post-operative PTA was 30.1 dB, a 26.6 dB improvement. Initial average ABG was 29.7 dB, while post-operative ABG averaged 5.4 dB, a 24.2 dB improvement. Surgical success (closure of ABG within 10 dB) was achieved in 263 (84%) patients. Rate of surgical success was not correlated with age, gender, race, or affected ear.

There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of early and late recurrences between the two groups. Modified Epley maneuver can be applied in a short interval time with comparable success and recurrence rates which are as effective as in a long interval time. The Epley maneuver is called the particle repositioning or canalith repositioning procedure. If a short time interval in each position is effective, it will allow for reduced time and avoid unnecessary physical burden. How long of a stay in each position is not determined in the literature. There is an absence of comparative studies of the BPPV repositioning time. The aim of this study is to compare the treatment time in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Longitudinal prospective study. Outpatient practice in a tertiary care facility. Sixty consecutive patients with BPPV were included in this study. These patients were sequentially allocated to one of two groups (A or B). The interval times between each position in group A and B were 15 and 120 s, respectively. Modified Epley maneuver was performed in all patients. The maneuvers in both groups were exactly the same sequence of movements, except interval times. The mean age of the patients was 49.25 years (range =19-76 years). Of the 60 patients, 48 (80%) were women and 12 (20%) were men. Successful outcome was achieved in 26 patients (86.7%) after the first modified Epley maneuver in both groups. Three patients from each group (total six patients) responded to the third modified Epley maneuver and the remaining two patients did not respond to any modified Epley maneuver.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder with an incidence between 10.7 and 17.3 per 100,000 persons per year. The mechanism for BPPV has been postulated to involve displaced otoconia resulting in canalithiasis. Although particulate matter has been observed in the endolymph of affected patients undergoing posterior canal occlusion surgery, an otoconial origin for the disease is still questioned. In this study, particulate matter was extracted from the posterior semicircular canal of two patients and examined with scanning electron microscopy. The samples were obtained from two patients intraoperatively during posterior semicircular canal occlusion. The particles were fixed, stored in ethanol, and chemically dehydrated. The samples were sputter coated and viewed under a scanning electron microscope. Digital images were obtained. Intact and degenerating otoconia with and without linking filaments were found attached to amorphous particulate matter. Many otoconia appeared to be partially embedded in a gel matrix, presumably that which encases and anchors the otoconia within the otolith membrane, whereas others stood alone with no attached filaments and matrix. The otoconia measured roughly 2 to 8 μm in length and displayed a uniform outer shape with a cylindrical bulbous body and a 3 + 3 rhombohedral plane at each end. These findings suggest that the source of the particulate matter in the semicircular canals of patients with BPPV is broken off fragments of the utricular otolithic membrane with attached and detached otoconia.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common type of vertigo caused by the peripheral vestibular system. The majority of cases are accepted as idiopathic. Calcium metabolism also plays a primary role in the synthesis/absorption of otoconia made of calcium carbonate and thus might be an etiological factor in the onset of BPPV. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of osteoporosis and vitamin D in the etiology of BPPV by comparing BPPV patients with hospital-based controls. This is a case-control study comparing the prevalence of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency in 78 BPPV patients and 78 hospital-based controls. The mean T-scores and serum vitamin D levels were compared. The risk factors of osteoporosis, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and blood pressure were all compared between the groups. To avoid selection bias, the groups were stratified as subgroups according to age, sex, and menopausal status. In this study, the rates of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency detected in BPPV patients were reasonably high. But there was no significant difference in mean T-scores and vitamin D levels, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency prevalence between the BPPV group and controls. The prevalence of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency is reasonably high in the general population. Unlike the general tendencies in the literature, our study suggests that osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency are not risk factors for BPPV; we conclude that the coexistence of BPPV with osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency is coincidental.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder, accounting for 20% of all vertigo cases. Idiopathic BPPV is most common between the ages of 50 and 70, although the condition is found in all age groups. This study was conducted in our institute on 90 patients who presented to the outpatient department with history of vertigo and were diagnosed with BPPV via a positive Dix Hallpike test. Patients were randomnly placed in three groups of 30 each. Patients in Group A were treated with Epleys manoeuvre alone, in Group B were treated with Epleys Manouvre followed by oral Betahistine and patients in Group C were treated with Betahistine alone. All the patients were followed up after 1 week and 4 weeks following treatment. In our study we found that patients responded better when they were treated with Epleys Manouvre with Betahistine with less relapse and recurrence. Treatment with Epleys manouvre resulted in early improvement of symptoms. It was found in our study that Betahistine as a sole modality of treatment of vertigo in BPPV can be preferred in patients who are unfit to undergo canal repositioning manouvres.</td>

	<td>The traditional approach to dizziness encourages providers to emphasize the type of dizziness. However, symptom types might substantially overlap in individual patients, thus limiting the clinical value of this approach. We aimed to describe the overlap of types of dizziness using a US nationally representative sample. The 2008 US National Health Interview Survey was examined for prevalence and overlap of types of dizziness. The data were also separately examined among people who otherwise had typical features of traditionally vertigo-based disorders (ie, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Meniere's disease). Data analysis also included exploratory factor analysis. Twelve-month prevalence of problems with dizziness or balance was 14.8%, representing 33.4 million individuals. The mean number of dizziness symptoms was 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-2.4), with 61.1% reporting more than one type. Of subjects who otherwise had typical features of traditionally vertigo-based disorders, the mean number of dizziness types was 3.1 (95% CI, 3.0-3.3), and only 24.6% (95% CI, 21.0%-28.7%) reported vertigo as the primary type. Exploratory factor analysis found that symptom types loaded onto a single factor without other clinical or demographic variables. Substantial overlap of dizziness types exists among US adults with dizziness. People otherwise having features of traditionally vertigo-based disorders also typically report multiple dizziness types and do not typically report vertigo as the primary type. Symptom types correlate more strongly with each other than with other clinical or demographic variables. These findings suggest that the traditional emphasis on dizziness types is likely of limited clinical utility.</td>

	<td>The test and treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are evidence-based practices supported by clinical guideline statements. Yet these practices are underutilized in the emergency department (ED) and interventions to promote their use are needed. To inform the development of an intervention, we interviewed ED physicians to explore barriers and facilitators to the current use of the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT) and the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM). We conducted semi-structured in-person interviews with ED physicians who were recruited at annual ED society meetings in the United States. We analyzed data thematically using qualitative content analysis methods. Based on 50 interviews with ED physicians, barriers that contributed to infrequent use of DHT/CRM that emerged were (1) prior negative experiences or forgetting how to perform them and (2) reliance on the history of present illness to identify BPPV, or using the DHT but misattributing patterns of nystagmus. Based on participants' responses, the principal facilitator of DHT/CRM use was prior positive experiences using these, even if infrequent. When asked which clinical supports would facilitate more frequent use of DHT/CRM, participants agreed supports needed to be brief, readily accessible, and easy to use, and to include well-annotated video examples. Interventions to promote the use of the DHT/CRM in the ED need to overcome prior negative experiences with the DHT/CRM, overreliance on the history of present illness, and the underuse and misattribution of patterns of nystagmus. Future resources need to be sensitive to provider preferences for succinct information and video examples.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) recurs frequently. This study aims to determine that each patient with BPPV has a predilection for a specific canal and the type of recurred BPPV can be predicted from that observed during the previous attack. The involved side (right, left, and bilateral) and affected canal (posterior, geotropic horizontal, apogeotropic horizontal, anterior, and mixed) were analyzed in 224 pairs of consecutive attacks of BPPV confirmed in 167 patients at the Dizziness Clinic of Seoul National Bundang Hospital from 2003 to 2017. We defined the recurrence when patients had the redevelopment of BPPV at least 1 week after resolution of the previous one. During the initial attack, the involved canals were posterior in 134 (59.8%), geotropic horizontal in 53 (23.7%), apogeotropic horizontal in 27 (12.1%), anterior in 5 (2.2%), and mixed in 5 (2.2%). The right ear was more commonly affected than the left ear [132 (58.9%) vs. 90 (40.2%)]. Two patients (0.9%) showed bilateral involvements. During the recurrences, the proportions of involved canals and affected side were similar irrespective of those during the former event. Only 24% of the patients showed the recurrence in the same canal on the same side. The patterns of recurrences are usually discordant in patients with BPPV. Instruction for self-administration of a specific canalith repositioning procedure based on the previous type of BPPV may have a limited efficacy in this frequently recurrent disorder.</td>

	<td>The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of dizziness occurring after a motor vehicle accident. We retrospectively analyzed 217 patients who had visited a tertiary medical center complaining of dizziness after a motor vehicle accident between January 2009 and December 2014. Of the 217 patients, we enrolled 54 patients who had undergone a vestibular function test and had no definite evidence of fracture of the temporal bone or intracranial lesions. Patients were divided into two groups: the dizziness group (group A, 29 patients) and the dizziness with audiological symptoms (hearing disturbance, tinnitus, ear fullness) group (group B, 25 patients). The prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was higher in group A. Apart from this finding, the clinical features did not differ significantly between the two groups. Group B had a higher number of patients who exhibited asymmetric hearing on pure tone audiometry, but the difference was not statistically significant. There were no notable characteristics in patients with dizziness after motor vehicle accidents, although patients without hearing symptoms tended to have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, whereas other patients tended to have hearing disturbance. This information may be helpful for clinicians in counseling and managing patients with dizziness and audiological symptoms after motor vehicle accidents.</td>

	<td>To determine the immediate and short-term efficacies of mastoid oscillation vs. Gufoni maneuver in treating the apogeotropic type of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (HC-BPPV), we designed a randomized, prospective, sham-controlled study. In eight dizziness clinics in Korea, 209 consecutive patients with apogeotropic HC-BPPV were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a single application of Gufoni (n = 70), mastoid oscillation (n = 67), or sham maneuver (n = 72). Immediate and second-day responses were determined based on the results within 1 h after a single trial of each maneuver and the following day, respectively. Second-day response was assessed in patients who were non-responders on the first day. The short-term response was determined based on the cumulative response for 2 days. Successful treatment was defined as a resolution of positional nystagmus or as a transition into geotropic horizontal nystagmus (not requires vertigo symptom resolution). The immediate responses of the Gufoni maneuver (33/70, 47.1%) and mastoid oscillation (32/67, 47.8%) were better than the sham maneuver (14/72, 19.4%) (p = 0.00). The second-day results did not differ among the three groups (p = 0.76). The short-term responses showed better efficacies with the Gufoni maneuver (51/70, 76.1%) and mastoid oscillation (46/67, 71.9%) than with the sham maneuver (38/72, 53.5%) (p = 0.02). Therapeutic efficacies did not differ between the Gufoni and mastoid oscillation groups in terms of both immediate and short-term outcomes (p = 0.94, 0.57). Both the Gufoni maneuver and mastoid oscillation are valid methods for treating apogeotropic HC-BPPV, with a success rate of approximately 70% for a single maneuver during the short-term follow-up. clinicaltrials.gov identifier number: NCT02046980.</td>

	<td>Several previous studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, secondary causes, physical inactivity, and osteoporosis may cause recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, there has also been some controversy over the clinical course(s) and cause(s) of recurrent BPPV (rBPPV). We identified clinical features and associated factors, including decreased bone mineral density, in the recurrence of BPPV. In total, 198 patients with idiopathic BPPV, diagnosed at the otolaryngology clinics of Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, were enrolled. The medical data of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. Recurrent BPPV was defined as the recurrence of BPPV after at least 1 month of a symptom-free interval following previous successful treatment. Of the BPPV patients, 67 (33.8%) were classified as rBPPV. Among them, about 16% showed changes in the involved semicircular canals and about 6% showed multiple semicircular canal involvement. rBPPV was more common in patients with comorbidities (P<0.001). Involved semicircular canals showed no statistically significant difference according to the recurrence of BPPV. The mean symptom-free interval of the rBPPV group varied from 1 to 50.2 (mean, 11.6) months; however, 90% of BPPV recurrence occurred within 24 months. Bone mineral density in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was markedly decreased in BPPV patients versus normal controls, but there were no significant differences according to BPPV recurrence. The incidence of rBPPV in idiopathic BPPV patients was 33.8% in the present study. The mean period of recurrence after a symptom-free interval was about 11.6 months; most patients showed recurrence within 2 years after the first attack of BPPV. Furthermore, about 16% of patients suffered from rBPPV at a different kind or type of canal from the semicircular canal of the initial BPPV attack. Comorbidities, but not age, gender, or the involved semicircular canal, might be correlated with BPPV recurrence. Decreased bone mineral density did not show significant association with BPPV recurrence, but showed a significant relation with BPPV occurrence.</td>

	<td>A new method for the treatment of a subtype of postural unsteadiness frequently seen in the medical office is proposed. Ten years of successful practical application and continuous refining of this new treatment lead to the definition of symptom-criteria, which are useful to distinguish patients, who get benefit by this new procedure and to a modified model of the utricular macula. In a retrospective collection, the data of 15 patients with postural unsteadiness (mean duration of symptoms 61.7 months) successfully treated with the new maneuver are reported.<br><br>Before treatment, all patients showed normal results in testing the caloric responses of the labyrinth, normal neurological investigation and no signs for cervical vertigo.<br><br>Before and after treatment the DHI-score (Dizziness Handicap Index) was achieved by using the German version of the DHI-questionnaire. In all groups before and after treatment balance testing was performed using a posturography platform. Application of the new treatment lead to a significant improvement of the DHI-scores and of the posturographic results (significant reduction of body sway). The patients, who were successfully treated by the new maneuver have had presented the same symptoms like patients with a proven utricular dysfunction. This leads to a slightly modified model of the utricular macula. Beyond correctly positioned otoconia in the utricular macula and free otoconia in the endolymphatic utricular space, a third fraction of dysfunctional partially detached otoconia is postulated (causing the unsteadiness). Based on this theory, the single hair-cell with its accompanied otoconium might be the smallest receptor-unit of the macula-organ. This smallest receptor-unit might represent a biological mass-spring-system. According to technical mass-spring-systems used as accelerometers, the different sizes of the otoconia for a distinct direction of acceleration are necessary for covering different frequency-bands.<br><br>Finally, a many years successfully tested modified variation of the new maneuver for treatment in the medical office and for self-treatment is proposed.</td>

	<td>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the otolith function in the patients presenting with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (pBPPV) attributable to the occlusion of the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) of the inner ear with the use of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP). Cervical (cVEMP) and ocular VEMP (oVEMP) were measured in 34 patients with idiopathic pBPPV before and 7 days after the treatment by means of reposition maneuvers. The results of the repeated Dix-Hallpike test performed 7 days after the repositioning maneuver were negative in 27 patients and positive in 7 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the amplitude of cervical VEMP between the healthy and affected ears either before or after the repositioning treatment. The measurement of oVEMP revealed a reduction of the response amplitude on the affected side. The average values of the plnl on the healthy side were 12.84±1.09 and those on the affected side 4.62±0.69 (p<0,05). The successful repositioning treatment resulted in a significant increase of the oVEMP amplitude on the affected side (p<0,05). In the patients presenting with the persistent symptoms of pBPPV, the repositioning maneuvers did not cause an appreciable increase in the amplitude of oVEMP on the affected side (p<0.05). The results of the present study give evidence that pBPPV of the posterior semicircular canal is associated with the impairment of the function of the receptor structures of the utriculus and the preserved function of the succulus as suggested by the reduction of the oVEMP amplitude and clinically significant asymmetry of ocular VEMP on the affected side with intact cervical VEMP on both sides. The successful treatment of pBPPV of PSCC with the use of the liberatory maneuver results in the increase of the oVEMP amplitude on the affected side increases while the response asymmetry between both sides significantly decreases which indicates the repair of the utriculus otolith function.</td>

The best explored are the following causes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: vestibular neuronitis, head injuries, and disorders in the middle ear. During the recent years, much attention has been given to the role of disturbances of calcium metabolism and osteoporosis in etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

	<td>To analyze typical medical practice in managing patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 33 patients (5 men and 28 women; mean age, 58 years) with BPPV who had been referred for consultation to the Medical Diagnostic Department, Clinic of Nervous Diseases, I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, regarding for vertigo, were examined. Information about the disease before visiting the clinic, such as the duration of vertigo, its pattern, and triggers, previously established diagnoses, prescribed treatment and its efficacy, concomitant diseases, was analyzed. BPPV was not timely diagnosed in 93.9% of cases. The cause of vertigo was most commonly mistakenly assumed to be cerebrovascular disease (66.6%) and cervical spine pathology (15.1%). During a primary examination, none of the patients underwent positional tests (otoneurological examination) that formed the basis for the diagnosis of BPPV. Alternatively, 90.3% of cases underwent instrumental examination: magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, X-ray of the cervical spine, and ultrasonic duplex scanning of the brachiocephalic arteries. Ineffective diagnosis led to the choice of nonoptimal treatment tactics: instead of therapeutic repositioning maneuvers (RM), the patients received therapy with drugs, such as various vasoactive agents (84.8%), nootropic and chondroprotective drugs (12%), or muscle relaxants (9.1%). After BPPV was detected, all patients underwent curative RM, which resulted in regression of the disease. One-year follow-up of the patients showed that the therapeutic effect of RM persisted. Lack of effective and timely diagnosis of BPPV reflects physicians' poor awareness that this condition is the most common cause of vestibular vertigo. The role of vascular and cervicogenic factors in the development of vertigo is overestimated. Most patients with BPPV undergo unreasonable examinations and receive ineffective treatment. It is necessary to raise awareness of BPPV among of physicians and to set up specialized centers for the management of patients with dizziness.</td>

The present study aimed to evaluate the association between Ca2+ and vitamin D status and BPPV occurrence as well as the status of bone biochemical markers in osteoporotic patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV. The study included total 132 patients who were referred to our clinic between August 2008 and October 2013. Based on the bone mineral density (BMD) results, the subjects were divided into three groups: normal BMD (n = 34), osteopenia (n = 40) and osteoporosis (n = 58). The biochemical markers of bone turnover including serum Carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and urinary free deoxypyridinoline (u-DPD), were analyzed, along with the serum Ca2+ and vitamin D levels. The mean serum calcium, phosphate and creatinine clearance levels were within the standard laboratory reference range. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was 11.8% (4/34) in the normal BMD group, 15% (6/40) in the osteopenia group and 43.1% (25/58) in the osteoporosis group. There was a positive correlation between the 25(OH)D and BMD results in the patients with BPPV. Among the bone turnover markers, the osteocalcin and u-DPD levels were significantly elevated in the osteoporotic patients with BPPV. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency were associated with BPPV. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of BPPV in osteoporotic patients is associated with vitamin D deficiency and high bone turnover rates at systemic level, which could disturb local Ca2+ homeostasis in the inner ear.</td>

	<td>Children differ from adults in the expression of dizziness symptoms and the causes of dizziness. In several studies, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC) and vestibular migraine (VM) were seen exclusively in children with vertigo, but the age threshold used to define 'children' varies, and there are few reported studies about adolescents with dizziness. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of vestibular and balance disorders according to age category in a multi-center study (otolaryngology departments of 11 hospitals) of children and adolescents. Children and adolescents aged under 18 who visited the otolaryngology departments of 11 hospitals for dizziness were included. We classified the patients into three categories: preschool (up to and including 6-year-olds), school age (7- to 12-year-olds), and adolescents (13- to 18-year-olds). These patients were reviewed retrospectively based on their clinical charts. In the preschool age group, BPVC was most common, followed by VM. In the school-age group, BPVC and VMs were most common, followed by psychogenic vertigo and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In adolescents, VM was the most common, and Ménière's disease, cardiogenic vertigo, and BPVC, which are seen primarily in adults, were also seen in some adolescents. In children and adolescents with dizziness, VM and BPVC were the most common diseases, and prevalence of disease by age showed differing distributions. These findings will help in diagnosing and managing children and adolescents with vertigo.</td>

	<td>To explore the clinical value of rolling test（HRT）, bow and lean test（BLT） and subjective vertigo sensation(SVS) for affected side localization of patients with horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo（HSC-BPPV）. One hundred and thirty-eight patients（94 HSC-Can and 44 HSC-Cup）with HSC-BPPV were enrolled. Patients were tested with HRT and then were asked about SVS, followed by BLT. According to the results of HRT, SVS and BLT, HSC-Can and HSC-Cup were repositioned by Barbecue method and modified Kim method respectively. The detection rate of the affected side of HRT, BLT, SVS and the curative effect were analyzed.  In 94 HSC-Can patients and 44 HSC-Cup patients,BN and / or LN were induced by BLT to be 81.91% and 84.09% respectively. HRT induced bilateral asymmetric nystagmus 90.43%, 88.64%, SVS told vertigo symptoms worse side 60.64%,63.64%. There was no significant difference in the detection rate of HRT and BLT( >0.05)，but have significant difference with SVS( <0.05). Excluding four patients in whom the comparison among HRT,BLT,SVS were inconclusive，we compared the curative effect of first treatment in 92 HSC-Can patients and 42 HSC-Cup patients. The curative effect of HRT positive only were 66.67% and 60.00% respectively , BLT positive only were 71.43% and 66.67% respectively , HRT and BLT both positive with ipsilateral affected side were 70.37% and 65.50% respectively , HRT and BLT both positive with contralateral affected side were 37.50% and 30.00% respectively. The curative effect of HRT positive only and BLT positive only had no significant difference with that of HRT and BLT both positive with ipsilateral affected side , but they both had significant difference with that of HRT and BLT both positive with contralateral affected side .  HRT is the most effective method for detecting affected side of HSC-BPPV, but BLT and SVS also have auxiliary diagnostic value as HSC-BPPV localization method.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. Numerous investigations have reported an increased BPPV incidence in females and in the aged population. The hormonal characteristics of BPPV patients have not been previously investigated. This study aimed to determine the risk of BPPV in relation to menopause in a population-based study.  : This retrospective population-based study was designed to use a nationwide longitudinal health insurance database to follow and analyze the incidence of and protective factors against BPPV in a Taiwanese population.  : Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for the incidence of BPPV using Cox-proportional regression models.  : In the multivariate analyses, we found that older people (older than 65 years old) were more prone to develop BPPV (aHR: 5.37, 95% CI: 0 4.83-5.97,   < 0.001). The risk of BPPV was analyzed in two specific age subgroups of elderly females. Results revealed that in both age groups (45-65 years old and >65 years old), patients who took estrogen for menopausal syndromes had a significantly lower incidence of BPPV (aHR; 0.01, 95% CI: 0.06-0.23,   < 0.001).  : Our study provides a novel etiology and possible treatment method for the prevention of BPPV. Further studies may focus on the pathophysiological mechanism of estrogen in BPPV patients and the development of new drugs for the prevention and treatment of BPPV.</td>

We reviewed all PC-BPPV patients admitted to our department between January and -December 2016. The inclusion criteria mainly required conducting a diagnosis for PC-BPPV by using the Dix-Hallpike test, a PC-BPPV history within 1 month, no intake of medications for the last 48 h. Compared with the cases who received classical manual repositioning treatment (CMRT), the proportion of patients who underwent AMRT with a resolution within the 1-week follow-up session after initial treatment and a recurrence during the 6-month follow-up were evaluated. A total of182 patients who underwent AMRT and 152 patients who underwent CMRT were included. Compared with the CMRT group, the AMRT group had a higher rate of complete or partial resolution and positional nystagmus at the 1 week follow-up (92.6 vs. 86.2%; p = 0.004). AMRT with less treatment cycles was more effective than CMRT (1.5 vs. 1.9; p < 0.001). After 6 months of follow-up, the cumulative recurrence rate of the AMRT group was significantly lower than that of the CMRT group (3.0 vs. 8.9%; p = 0.037).

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is characterized by recurrent episodes of positional vertigo due to dislodged otoconia debris within the semicircular canals. Many studies have proposed a correlation between Vitamin-D deficiency and recurrent BPPV. In the UK, serum Vitamin-D falls during the winter, reaching its lowest level in May and it is highest level in September. We hypothesize that if there is a relationship between BPPV and Vitamin-D levels, one would expect to see a seasonal variation in the incidence of BPPV among UK residents. A retrospective review of clinic letters and general practitioner referrals for patients presenting to a University Otolaryngology department over a 4-year period. Patients were divided into two groups: those presenting during the months associated with low serum Vitamin-D levels, and those presenting during the months associated with high serum Vitamin-D levels. Three hundred thirty-nine patients were identified with posterior canal BPPV as a consequence of having had a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver recorded in the clinical notes between October 2012 and October 2016. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrated there to be a statistically significant difference between the low serum Vitamin-D group and the high serum Vitamin-D group (p = 0.0367). The results confirm that there is a seasonal variation in the incidence of BPPV. This study is important as it adds to the mounting literature suggesting an association between serum Vitamin-D levels and BPPV. Second, it suggests a therapeutic strategy to improve outcomes in affected patients. Third, it adds significance to the hypothesized role of calcium metabolism for the development of inner ear disease.</td>

Our aim was to determine changes in certain parameters of the VEMP wave complex after successfully performed repositioning procedure, as an indicator of the state of recovery in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This may confirm the theory of otolith returning into the area of otolithic senses. The study included 48 patients with unilateral posterior semicircular canal BPPV. On their first arrival, otoneurological examinations, oVEMP and cVEMP tests were performed. The same were included in follow up check-ups scheduled at seven days and six months after successful implementation of Epley maneuvers. The initial measurement revealed a significantly reduced amplitude of oVEMP on the affected side. On the 7-day measurement, the amplitude increase was observed on the affected side, with significant reduction in the amplitude ratio (p=0.693), which reached statistical significance on the last measurement at 6 months (p=0.006).

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common type of peripheral vertigo. BPPV often relapses after the first episode, with a recurrence rate between 15% and 50%. To date both the aetiopathogenetic processes that lead to otoconia detachment and the factors that make BPPV a relapsing disease are still unclear, but recent epidemiological studies have shown a possible association with cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the present study (Sesto Senso Survey) was to evaluate in the Italian population through an observational survey, the main demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BPPV (first episode or recurrent) with particular focus on the potential cardiovascular risk factors. The survey was conducted in 158 vestibology centres across Italy on 2,682 patients (mean age 59.3 ± 15.0 years; 39.1% males and 60.9% females) suffering from BPPV, from January 2013 to December 2014. The results showed a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure (55.8%), hypercholesterolaemia (38.6%) and diabetes (17.7%), as well as a family history of cardiovascular disease (49.4%). A high percentage of patients also had hearing loss (42.9%), tinnitus (41.2%), or both (26.8%). The presence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly related to recurrent BPPV episodes (OR range between 1.84 and 2.31). In addition, the association with diabetes and thyroid/autoimmune disease (OR range between 1.73 and 1.89) was relevant. The survey results confirm the significant association between cardiovascular comorbidities and recurrent BPPV and identify them as a potential important risk factor for recurrence of BPPV in the Italian population, paving the way for the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of this disease.</td>

	<td>Horizontal semicircular canal BPPV (HSC-BPPV) can occur in 10-30% of BPPV cases. Lower success rates are reported for HSC-BPPV. The apogeotropic form of HSC-BPPV is more difficult to treat, as 5-40% of cases are described to be refractory to repositioning maneuvers. To describe the assessment and treatment of a patient presenting with HSC-BPPV and to demonstrate the potential use of Forced-Prolonged Positioning (FPP) as a home exercise program (HEP) for persistent HSC-BPPV in an elderly patient. An 89-year-old female referred to physical therapy with a diagnosis of BPPV. She experienced dizziness with positional changes and was found to have apogeotropic form of HSC-BPPV. To supplement maneuvers performed in the clinic, the patient was provided instructions for the FPP as her HEP. With continued symptoms and positive positional tests by week four of treatment, the patient was instructed to switch the FPP with the opposing ear directed toward the floor. Following 2 weeks of performing FPP on the opposite side, the patient reported symptoms had resolved and positional testing confirmed resolution of HSC-BPPV. There is a potential benefit of using FPP as a HEP to supplement maneuvers used in the clinic to improve outcomes in patients with HSC-BPPV that are refractory to traditional repositioning maneuvers. Prescribing the FPP maneuver as a HEP is feasible, and clinicians should consider the FPP technique as a HEP to adjunct repositioning maneuvers performed in the clinic to address persistent HSC-BPPV.</td>

	<td>To describe persistent post-stapedotomy vertigo (PSV) and its treatment using migraine prophylaxis. A retrospective review of all patients with persistent PSV spanning 10 years at a tertiary academic hospital was performed. Patients who experienced persistent vertigo for a minimum of 3 months after surgery were included. Those with possible perilymph fistula, long prosthesis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were excluded. All patients received instructions on migraine dietary and lifestyle changes and Vitamin B2 and magnesium. In addition, prophylactic treatment with nortriptyline, verapamil, or a combination thereof was started. Changes in vertigo frequency was the main outcome variable. The secondary outcome variables included the time period and medications necessary to achieve symptomatic resolution. Four women and one man with an average age of 53 years were identified that met criteria for persistent PSV indicating an incidence of 0.9% at our institution. The onset of vertigo symptoms was on average 20 days postoperatively. All five patients had daily vertigo episodes and experienced complete resolution with no vertigo episodes after treatment. Symptomatic resolution was achieved over an average of 9 weeks after initiating treatments. Persistent PSV beyond 3 months is a rare occurrence and its treatment can be challenging when there is no evidence of an underlying pathology. This subset of patients may be suffering from migraine, which was triggered postoperatively. Treatment with migraine prophylaxis in this cohort of patients may result in resolution of vertigo.</td>

Two thousand seventy-nine patients were assigned 2,468 diagnoses, of which 57.7 and 42.3% were of peripheral and nonperipheral etiologies, respectively. The most common diagnoses were Ménière's (23.0%), vestibular migraine (19.3%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (19.1%), and central origin, nonmigraine (16.4%). Peripheral diagnoses are more likely to be found in men than in women (odds ratio [OR] 1.59). Peripheral diagnoses were most likely to be found in the 60 to 69 age group (OR 3.82). There was not a significant difference in rate of vestibular testing between women and men. Among patients with two diagnoses, the most common combinations were vestibular migraine and BPPV then vestibular migraine and Ménière's. A large proportion of patients seen for the chief complaint of dizziness in the neurotology clinic were found not to have a peripheral etiology of their symptoms. These data challenge a prevalent dogma that the most common causes of dizziness are peripheral: BPPV, vestibular neuritis, and Ménière's disease. Age and sex are statistically significant predictors of peripheral etiology of dizziness.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common yet imprecise symptom. It was traditionally divided into four categories based on the patient's history: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and light-headedness. However, the distinction between these symptoms is of limited clinical usefulness. Patients have difficulty describing the quality of their symptoms but can more consistently identify the timing and triggers. Episodic vertigo triggered by head motion may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vertigo with unilateral hearing loss suggests Meniere disease. Episodic vertigo not associated with any trigger may be a symptom of vestibular neuritis. Evaluation focuses on determining whether the etiology is peripheral or central. Peripheral etiologies are usually benign. Central etiologies often require urgent treatment. The HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies. The physical examination includes orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required and are usually not helpful. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be treated with a canalith repositioning procedure (e.g., Epley maneuver). Treatment of Meniere disease includes salt restriction and diuretics. Symptoms of vestibular neuritis are relieved with vestibular suppressant medications and vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

The subjects underwent cVEMP testing to 500 and 1,000 Hz short tone bursts (125 dBSPL). The corrected amplitudes of the first biphasic responses (p13-n23) (cVEMP) were measured. Then, a tuning property index (the 500-1,000 Hz cVEMP slope) was calculated. The area of under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.75 in comparison with other vestibular disease patients, while AUC was 0.77 in comparison with other vestibular disease patients plus HC. The best cutoff point of the 500-1,000 Hz cVEMP slope was -19.9. Sensitivity of the tuning property test to MD was 0.74, while specificity was 0.76 to other vestibular disease patients.

	<td>The objectives of this study is to compare the efficacy between repetition of Epley maneuver and switch to alternate Semont maneuver in treating posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PC-BPPV) that does not respond to the initial Epley maneuver. In the nationwide, seven dizziness clinics of Korea, 506 consecutive patients (303 women, age range 22-87, mean age ± SD = 64 ± 12, median = 61) with idiopathic PC-BPPV were initially treated with a single Epley maneuver. Of those, 144 (28.5%) patients, who did not respond to the therapy, were randomized to the repetition of Epley maneuver (n = 70) or switch to Semont maneuver (n = 74). The therapeutic efficacy was determined within 1 h by a blinded examiner after the trial of each second maneuver. The efficacy did not differ between the repetition of Epley maneuver and switch to Semont maneuver groups (38.6 vs. 27.0%, p = 0.14, Chi-square test). However, the patients with a long duration (p < 0.001, linear regression) and latency (p = 0.01) of the positional nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike maneuver showed a higher rate of the initial and second treatment failures. Either Epley or Semont maneuver may be applied as a second treatment to the patients with PC-BPPV refractory to the initial Epley maneuver. This study provides Class I evidence that repeated Epley and switch to Semont maneuver shows a similar efficacy in treating PC-BPPV that does not respond to the initial Epley maneuver.

As a canalith repositioning procedure effectively treats H-BPPV with TGPN, but not PGPN, the differentiation between patients with PGPN and with TGPN is essential. The purpose of this study is to determine the observation period enough to distinguish TGPN from PGPN. This study first analyzed positional nystagmus images recorded with an infrared CCD camera three-dimensionally in 47 patients with H-BPPV. PGPN is distinguished from TGPN in patients with H-BPPV precisely by means of time constant calculated form analysis of positional nystagmus. Ten-second and 30-s movies were made of positional nystagmus of the all 47 patients. Ten independent otolaryngologists were then asked to distinguish TGPN from PGPN after a 10 s or 30 s observation of the geotropic positional nystagmus images in 47 patients with H-BPPV. The sensitivity and specificity to distinguish TGPN from PGPN was 100% and 97% after 30 s observation, but 100% and 40% after 10 s observation, respectively.</td>

Before the first and the last treatment, those patients were evaluated using Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and stabilometric platform to assess lifestyle modification and balance functions. After the treatment session, TG compared to SG showed an improvement in DHI global (p = 0.02), functional (p = 0.03) and physical (p = 0.03) components, as well as a reduction of swinging area (p = 0.02).

All patients were submitted to customize a 36 item of health survey on quality of life, short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory for assessing the disability. Individuals were diagnosed with acute unilateral vestibular peripheral disorders classified in 5 groups: vestibular neuritis, Ménière Disease, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, cochlear-vestibular dysfunction (other than Ménière Disease), or other type of acute peripheral vertigo (as vestibular migraine). There was a statistical significant difference for each parameter of Dizziness Handicap Inventory score (the emotional, functional and physical) between the baseline and one month both in men and women, but with any statistical significant difference between 7 days and 14 days. It was found a statistical significant difference for all eight parameters of SF-36 score between the baseline and one month later both in men and women; the exception was the men mental health perception. The correlation between the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the SF-36 scores according to diagnostics type pointed out that the Spearman's correlation coefficient was moderate correlated with the total scores of these instruments.

All the data were investigated to estimate the misdiagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the associated costs in Shanghai, China.   This study showed that the misdiagnosis rate of BPPV was 60.0% (48/80) and the common inappropriate diagnostic tests for BPPV included Cranial CT and MRI test, cervical MRI, cervical and cerebrovascular investigations et al. There was no significant difference between the misdiagnosis patients (48) and patients without misdiagnosis (32) in gender, age, duration of symptom, involved canal and type of BPPV.Complications were significantly more frequent in the misdiagnosis group than for those without[81.3%(39 /48) vs 34.4%(11 /32)]. The estimated costs for each misdiagnosed individual were 8 502.98 China Yuan (CNY) and one-year economic burden associated with the misdiagnosis of BPPV in Shanghai was 13.184 7-78.862 1 million CNY.   Our study suggests that the misdiagnosis rate of BPPV is high and the financial impact on patients and society with this disease is huge. The cost-effective Dix-Hallpike or supine roll test maneuver should be used before applying other expensive medical tests in order to minimize misdiagnosis and the waste of health care resources.</td>

To evaluate the outcomes obtained by clinical trials on the effectiveness of Otolith Repositioning Maneuver and Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises in the treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in elderly. The literature research was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and PEDro databases, and included randomized controlled clinical trials in English, Spanish and Portuguese, published during January 2000 to August 2016. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by PEDro score and the outcomes analysis was done by critical revision of content. Six studies were fully reviewed. The average age of participants ranged between 67.2 and 74.5 years. The articles were classified from 2 to 7/10 through the PEDro score. The main outcome measures analyzed were vertigo, positional nystagmus and postural balance. Additionally, the number of maneuvers necessary for remission of the symptoms, the quality of life, and the functionality were also assessed. The majority of the clinical trials used Otolith Repositioning Maneuver (n=5) and 3 articles performed Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises in addition to Otolith Repositioning Maneuver or pharmacotherapy. One study showed that the addition of movement restrictions after maneuver did not influence the outcomes. There was a trend of improvement in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo symptomatology in elderly patients who underwent Otolith Repositioning Maneuver. There is sparse evidence from methodologically robust clinical trials that examined the effects of Otolith Repositioning Maneuver and Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises for treating Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in the elderly.

Patients in the experimental group underwent balance VRT (50 min per session, two times a week) and Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (CRM) as required, for 13 weeks. The control group was treated using only CRM as required. Standing and dynamic balance, dizziness symptoms and quality of life were measured at the baseline, and at one, five, nine and thirteen weeks. There were no between-group differences in dizziness, quality of life and standing balance over the 13 weeks. Significant differences were observed in dynamic balance measures between groups (p <  0.05 for most tests) through assessments. In intragroup analysis, both groups showed improvements in all measurements except no improvement was found in majority of the dynamic balance tests in the control group. The patients who received additional balance VRT demonstrated better results in dynamic balance than those who received only CRM. Implications for Rehabilitation The findings that balance VRT in addition to CRM improves dynamic balance in elderly people with BPPV should be useful in guiding rehabilitation professionals' clinical decision making to design interventions for seniors suffering from BPPV; Improvements in tests of dynamic balance suggest that the risk of adverse consequences of BPPV in the elderly such as falls and fractures can be potentially reduced through implementation of CRM in conjunction with balance VRT; Lack of additional improvement in Visual Analogue Scale of dizziness and Dizziness Handicap Index suggests that addition of balance VRT does not influence dizziness symptomatology, per se, and CRM alone is effective to ameliorate vertiginous symptoms and potentially improve quality of life.</td>

	<td>Because of its multifaceted nature, dizziness is difficult for clinicians to diagnose and manage independently. Current treatment trends suggest that patients are often referred to the otolaryngologist for intervention despite having a nonotologic disorder. Additionally, many individuals with atypical presentations are often misdiagnosed and spend a significant amount of time waiting for consultation by the otolaryngologist. Few studies have alluded that implementation of an interprofessional team approach in the diagnosis and management of the dizzy patient can improve clinical decision-making. However, to the authors' knowledge, there is no information specifically quantifying the outcomes and potential benefits of using an interprofessional balance care team approach. To compare dizziness diagnoses trends and referral practices with and without the use of an interprofessional management approach within a university healthcare system. Over the course of a 3-yr period, a retrospective review of the diagnosis and management of dizziness was performed with and without implementation of an interprofessional team. To observe potential differences, year 3 incorporated the interprofessional management approach while years 1-2 did not. The two periods were then compared to each other. A total of 134 patients referred to a university hearing clinic for a vestibular and balance function evaluation. Diagnoses and management trends were examined with descriptive statistics (percentages and frequencies). Fisher's exact tests, analysis of contingency tables, were conducted to evaluate the influence of interprofessional management on dizziness diagnoses and treatment patterns. Results demonstrated that before implementation of an interprofessional team approach, (1) referring clinicians used unspecific dizziness diagnosis codes (e.g., dizziness and giddiness), (2) a low number of patients with dizziness were referred for balance function testing, (3) diagnoses remained unspecific following the balance function assessment, and (4) the most frequently occurring vestibular diagnoses were unilateral vestibular hypofunction and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Following the use of an interprofessional management approach, it was determined that (1) disease-specific diagnoses increased, (2) patients with dizziness were referred for balance function testing mainly by otolaryngologists, (3) dizziness was considered to be multifaceted for a greater number of patients, (4) a larger percentage of patients were referred to a specialist other than the otolaryngologist as a result of their diagnosis, and (5) patients reported reduction or resolution of their symptoms. An interprofessional management approach for the dizzy patient can lead to more specific diagnoses and provide alternative referral pathways to other health-care professionals (e.g., audiologists, physical therapists, and pharmacists) in an effort to reduce over-referral to one specialist. Future studies should address the utility of an interprofessional team approach in the overall management of patients with dizziness.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. Some repositioning maneuvers have been described for its management. The aim of this study was comparing the therapeutic effect of Epley and Gans maneuvers in BPPV. This randomized clinical trial was performed from September to December 2015. 73 patients with true vertigo diagnosed as BPPV enrolled the study. They randomly assigned in quadripartite blocks to modified Epley maneuver group (E) or Gans maneuver group (G). 1 day and 1 week after intervention, the objective and subjective responses to treatment were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test and regression model in the SPSS software version 21. Thirty patients enrolled each group with a mean age of 46.9 ± 13.4 (E group) and 46.7 ± 7.5 year (G group). 23.3 % of E group and 26.7 % of G group were men (p = 0.766). In E and G groups in the first day, subjective outcomes revealed 86.7 and 60 % rate of success (p = 0.02); and 86.7 and 56.7 % of patients exhibited objective improvement, respectively (p = 0.01). After 1 week, the subjective and objective outcomes revealed improvement among 70 % of E group and 46.7 % of G group (p = 0.067). The only complication with significant difference was cervical pain with a higher rate in E group (23.3 vs. 0.0 %, p = 0.005). These results revealed the similar long-term efficacy of Epley and Gans maneuver for the treatment of BPPV. Cervical pain was most frequent complication of Epley maneuver.</td>

Treatment with migraine lifestyle and prophylactic therapy, or Epley maneuver. Resolution of vertigo following medical treatment alone. Of the nine patients studied, seven (78%) suffered from vestibular migraine, and two (22%) experienced benign positional vertigo. All patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms after treatment. As a result of symptomatic improvement, seven patients (78%) avoided surgery in favor of observation, while two patients (22%) underwent radiosurgery due to continued tumor growth and other nonvertigo symptoms. VS patients can sometimes present with a history of recurrent episodic vertigo. The etiology of the vertigo could be due to the tumor itself or may be due to an underlying comorbidity such as vestibular migraine or benign positional vertigo. VS patients presenting with vertigo should undergo a standard vertigo history and examination to identify other potential causes of vertigo.

	<td>Deciphering the cause for a persistent, direction-changing geotropic nystagmus can be difficult. Migraine and light cupula are two possible causes, though can be confused with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) affecting the horizontal semicircular canal. In migraine, the persistent geotropic nystagmus tends to be slow; in light cupula, the nystagmus has been illustrated to beat in the direction opposite that of prone positioning. Here we describe a patient with initial occurrence then recurrence of a high velocity (≥30 deg/sec), persistent direction-changing geotropic nystagmus and vertigo with an intensity variable based on head position, which was difficult to manage. This patient did not have migraine. The case presented uniquely as it was unlikely due to canalithiasis of the horizontal semicircular canal yet the presentation was not clearly related to the light cupula phenomena either. In this case, the physical therapist attempted to use the barbeque roll canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM) even though the direction-changing geotropic nystagmus was persistent. The nystagmus did not resolve during the clinic visit. The persistent, high velocity geotropic nystagmus resolved within 1 week, however, this resolution was likely spontaneous and not due to the CRM intervention. Our case suggests that physical therapists assessing persistent geotropic nystagmus should wait long enough for the nystagmus to stop (∼2 minutes), test for fatigue by repeating the positional nystagmus tests, incorporate a head flexion component as part of the positional testing, and attempt to identify a null point.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A178).</td>

The patients were examined before treatment and again one week after treatment. We analyzed how various general factors and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials related to residual dizziness. Residual dizziness was not related to gender, affected side, age, duration of symptoms, recurrence, or the results of the initial ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential test (p > .05).

	<td>Vertigo is a debilitating disease that is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that are commonly used to alleviate symptoms. We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in the treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED. We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban, teaching ED. We randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral vertigo (APV) to diazepam 5 mg or meclizine 25 mg orally. Demographic and historical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and after 30 min (t30) and 60 min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean change in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated that a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% power to detect a difference of 20 mm between treatment groups. There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine group. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and presenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and meclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence interval -20 to 12; p = 0.60). We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.</td>

	<td>To demonstrate positional nystagmus during a head-roll test in two patients with lateral semicircular canal (LSCC) cupulolithiasis who presented with spontaneous detachment of otoliths from the LSCC cupula, and to confirm that otoliths may adhere to both the utricle and canal sides of the cupula. Using video nystagmography, positional nystagmus was evaluated in two patients with LSCC cupulolithiasis who showed the change of nystagmus direction during a head-roll test. Both patients presented with persistent left-beating and right-beating nystagmus when the head was bent forward and backward, respectively. This suggests the presence of either cupulolithiasis on the right side or light cupula on the left side of the LSCC. In Case 1, transformation from cupulolithiasis to canalolithiasis occurred, implicating the detachment of otoliths from the canal side of the right LSCC cupula. In Case 2, vigorous right-beating nystagmus was followed by persistent left-beating nystagmus when the head was rolled to the left. Following this, direction-fixed left-beating nystagmus was observed at all positions, which may indicate that otoliths attached on utricle side of the right LSCC cupula were detached and fell into the utricle under the influence of gravity. A conversion of nystagmus direction may be explained by an expression of short-term adaptation of vestibular tone. Otoliths can be attached to either side of the cupula in LSCC cupulolithiasis. Because it is difficult to determine the attached side at the time of diagnostic maneuver, the therapeutic approach should include maneuvers designed to detach otolith particles from both the utricle and canal side.</td>

Recommendations include clinical approaches (repositioning manoeuvres), medication (adding, removing or changing current medication depending on aetiology), vestibular physiotherapy, ergotherapy and rehabilitation, treatment of chest pain or stroke units and surgical interventions. If symptoms are acute and severe, medication with antivertigo agents is recommended as a first step, for a maximum period of 3 days. Following initial symptom control, treatment is tailored depending on aetiology. To assist the clinician in obtaining a useful overview, the level of evidence and number needed to treat are reported whenever possible based on study characteristics. In addition, warnings about possible arrhythmias due to medication are issued, and precautions to enable these to be avoided are discussed.</td>

This can include wearing a cervical collar. Does the use of BPPV postprocedure restriction with a cervical collar impact on the number of PRMs required to resolve a patient's symptoms? Combination of retrospective and prospective review of 624 patients treated in a tertiary UK hospital. All were diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV and received a modified Epley maneuver (PRM). The "with cervical collar" (WC) retrospective group 2002 to 2009 (n = 263) were advised to wear a cervical collar for 48 hours postprocedure, and the "no cervical collar" (NC) prospective group 2010 to 2014 (n = 361) were not. The main outcome measure was the resolution of patient symptoms following a PRM for BPPV. Quantitative and statistical analysis using χ test was undertaken. In the WC group, 84% (n = 221) had resolution of symptoms after the first PRM, versus 82.8% (n = 299) in the NC group. After the second PRM 11% (n = 29) resolved, versus 13.6% (n = 49) in the NC group. After the third PRM 4.9% (n = 13) resolved, versus 3.6% (n = 13) in the NC group. Both clinically and statistically there was no significant difference in outcome between groups. Our review of 624 patients is the largest study in this subject and the results demonstrate that wearing a cervical collar following PRM for BPPV concedes no significant benefit. Excluding this from postprocedure guidance allows patients to manage without the inconvenience of wearing a cervical collar, and allows departments to update clinical guidance.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (otolith disease) is the most common neurological and position change related vertigo, accounting for 17-20% of peripheral vertigo. BPPV occur in the elderly. The high incidence age for BPPC was 50 to 70 years and mostly in female. According to the different parts of the lesions, it is divided into anterior canal BPPV (AC-BPPV), posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV), horizontal canal BPPV (HC-BPPV). Studies have shown that the incidence of PC-BPPV was 86.36%, the incidence of HC-BPPV was 11.37%, the incidence rate of AC-BPPV was 2.27%. Treatment for PC-BPPV includes manual reduction, drug treatment, psychological treatment, and surgical treatment. Repositioning is the preferred method for the treatment of PC-BPPV with high effective rate and low risk. The mechanism is through the different changes of head position to make the otolith back to utricle. Many manual reduction methods have been reported in clinical treatment of PC-BPPV. With the increasing emphasis on the BPPV, a variety of new methods are being developed and designed.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and migraine-associated dizziness are common. The prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo seems to be higher in patients with migraine-associated dizziness than in those without migraine. A database of 508 patients seen at the primary author's balance clinic was analysed to determine the prevalence of migraine, as defined by International Headache Society criteria, in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The percentage of patients with dizziness or vertigo who met criteria for migraine was 33.7 per cent, with a prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of 42.3 per cent. When excluding patients with migrainous vertigo, patients with migraine frequently had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (66.7 per cent vs 55.8 per cent), although this finding was not statistically significant. The results for the entire sample suggest that, after excluding patients with migrainous vertigo, patients with migraine seem more likely to have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; however, this association was not significant, probably because of the small sample size.</td>

	<td>To evaluate whether a repeated canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) influences the residual symptoms and the rate of recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with post-CRP dizziness. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 292 patients at the referral center for ENT diseases with a first episode of BPPV treated with a single CRP following clinical practice guidelines. In 178 patients (67.9%) who presented dizziness after BPPV recovery at the follow-up visit, 94 patients underwent CRP (treated group) and 84 did not (non-treated group). A subjective evaluation of vertigo was made by way of a questionnaire. The rates of recurrence of BPPV and residual dizziness were statistically compared between the treated and the non-treated groups; survival analysis was carried out as well. In an observational period ranging from 1 to 6years, BPPV recurred in 122 subjects (46.6%) of the investigated population. Among the patients with residual dizziness, the difference in rate of recurrence of BPPV between the treated group and the non-treated group was not statistically significant (p=0.84). The treated group presented a significantly higher rate of recovery from dizziness compared to the non-treated group (p<0.001). A repeated CRP in patients with post-CRP dizziness increased the rate of recovery from dizziness but had no influence on BBPV recurrence.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the main causes of vertigo. More than 90% of cases of positional vertigo and nystagmus can be associated with BPPV. There is no known specific laboratory test for BPPV. Because of the possible muscle activity in BPPV (especially result of nause, vomiting and increasing heart rate) we thought the CK-MB levels may change in this situation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between serum CK-MB levels and BPPV and attacks. The medical records of 35 patients with BPPV presenting to our clinic between November 2014 and November 2015 were investigated retrospectively. Thirty-two control patients with no vertigo, muscular or cardiac disease and with measured CK-MB levels were randomized into a control group. Both groups' existing CK-MB levels were obtained from the patient records. CK-MB values measured before BPPV attack from 11 patients in the patient group were also recorded. The patient and control groups were similar in terms of demographic parameters. CK-MB values at time of attack in the patient group ranged between 5.4 and 38.9 (mean: 19.67 ± 6.81), while control group values ranged between 12 and 27.9 (mean: 20.31 ± 4.54). CK-MB values in 11 patients in the patient group measured before attack ranged between 8.9 and 24 (mean: 17.02 ± 4.97), and CK-MB values during attack ranged between 9 and 34 (mean: 19.74 ± 7.64). Although CK-MB elevation at time of attack was determined in patients with BPPV, this was not statistically significant.</td>

	<td>Multiple canal BPPV can be a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. This is due in part to the complex anatomy of the labyrinth but also to complex and often simultaneous ocular responses that result from stimulation of multiple canals during traditional diagnostic testing. Our objective was to analyze the Dix-Hallpike maneuver used in the diagnosis of BPPV to look for patterns of simultaneous canal response and to develop a diagnostic maneuver that will allow separation of canal responses in multiple canal BPPV. A previously created and published 3D biomechanical model of the human labyrinths for the study of BPPV was used to analyze and compare the position and movement of otoliths in the Dix-Hallpike maneuver as well as in a proposed expanded version of the traditional Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The traditional Dix-Hallpike maneuver with the head hanging may promote movement of otoliths in 5 of the six semicircular canals. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver with the head lowered only to the horizontal position allows for otoconia in only the lowermost posterior canal to fall to the most gravity dependent position. This position allows for minimal or no movement of otoconia in the contralateral posterior canal, or in either superior canal. Turning the head ninety degrees to the opposite side while still in the horizontal position will provoke otolith movement in only the contralateral posterior canal. The superior canals can then be examined for free otolith debris by extending the neck to a head-hanging position. These positions may be assumed directly from one to the next in the lying position. There seems to be no advantage to sitting up between positions. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver may cause simultaneous movement of otoliths present in multiple canals and create an obstacle to accurate diagnosis in multi-canal BPPV. An expanded Dix-Hallpike maneuver is described which adds intermediate steps with the head positioned to the right and left in the horizontal position before head-hanging. This expanded maneuver has helped to isolate affected semi-circular canals for individual assessment in multiple canal BPPV.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is not a well-defined disease but a symptom that can occur in heterogeneous entities diagnosed and treated mainly by otolaryngologists, neurologists, internal medicine, and primary care physicians. Most vertigo syndromes have a good prognosis and management is predominantly conservative, whereas the need for surgical therapy is rare, but for a subset of patients often the only remaining option. In this paper, we describe and discuss different surgical therapy options for hydropic inner ear diseases, Menière's disease, dehiscence syndromes, perilymph fistulas, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. At the end, we shortly introduce the most recent developments in regard to vestibular implants. Surgical therapy is still indicated for vestibular disease in selected patients nowadays when conservative options did not reduce symptoms and patients are still suffering. Success depends on the correct diagnosis and choosing among different procedures the ones going along with an adequate patient selection. With regard to the invasiveness and the possible risks due to surgery, in depth individual counseling is absolutely necessary. Ablative and destructive surgical procedures usually achieve a successful vertigo control, but are associated with a high risk for hearing loss. Therefore, residual hearing has to be included in the decision making process for surgical therapy.</td>

	<td>Objective To determine the incidence of surgical complications associated with superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) repair and identify the demographic, medical, and intraoperative risk factors that are associated with SCDS complications. Study Design Cases series with chart review, including patients who underwent SCDS repair between 1996 and 2015. Setting A tertiary care academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Data were collected from 220 patients, including demographic information, medical comorbidities, prior otologic surgical history, surgical approach, intraoperative findings, and postoperative complications. Relative risk analysis and multivariable logistic regression evaluated the associations between perioperative risk factors and SCDS complications. Results A total of 242 consecutive cases were performed: 95.5% middle fossa and 4.5% transmastoid approach (mean age: 47.8 ± 10.6 years; 54.5% female). Surgical complications were reported in 27 (11.2%) cases; 20 (8.3%) had Clavien-Dindo grade I complications, most commonly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (n = 11, 4.5%) and profound sensorineural hearing loss (n = 6, 2.5%). Two cases (0.8%) had grade II; 4 cases (1.7%), grade III; and 1 case (0.4%), grade IV complications. In the analysis of comorbidities, only preoperative coagulopathy was significantly associated with increased risk of complications (relative risk = 6.4, P < .01). Following multivariate logistic regression adjusting for demographic covariates, coagulopathy was still associated with increased odds of complications (odds ratio = 15.7, P = .03). There were no significant associations between other risk factors and complications. Conclusion SCDS repair has low rates of adverse events. We observed an incidence of 11.2% complications, most commonly postoperative benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The risk of nonotologic intracranial complications (1.7%) is low.</td>

The 118 cases were tested with different positioning tests in the sequence of Dix hallpike test and rolling test. Then, proper otolith manual reduction was given.  In 118 cases of BPPV after trauma including 35 cases of skull fracture, 6 cases of concussion, 17 cases of scalp hematoma, 28 cases of scalp laceration, 14 cases of mild brain contusion and 18 cases of head combined injury. The distributions of head injury were 57 at front temporal, 24 at top, 22 at occipital and 15 at maxillofacial region. The latency of BPPV after head injury varies from 1day to 1month. The incidence of 3-7 day after head injury was the highest, followed by 7-14 days, 0-3 days, and the lowest incidence rate of 14 day to 1 month. Canal type 118 BPPV patients after head injury accounting for up to 57.6% of the horizontal semicircular canal accounted for 33.1%, mixed 9.3%.  The patients with front temporal trauma and skull fracture were prone to have BPPV. The peak incidence of BPPV was 3-14 days after head injury. The most common type of BPPV was PC BPPV, and the HC BPPV was the second type. A good curative effect can be manipulative reduction after trauma BPPV..</td>

This study developed a murine model of traumatic BPPV and observed the changes in otoconia detachment over time. Six-week-old CBA mice were used in this study. Otoconia detachment was induced by vibrating the head for 2 min. Utricles of mice were harvested from different groups: before the head vibration and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after vibration application. Using scanning electron microscopy and ImageJ software, the percentage of the intact area of otoconia in the utricle was calculated. Hearing thresholds were compared among the groups. The mean (± SD) percentages of the intact area of otoconia in the utricle were 98.1% ± 1.7% before the vibration and 93.6% ± 1.7%, 88.9% ± 5.3%, 78.2% ± 20.9%, and 38.9% ± 24.1% at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the vibration, respectively.

Decremental time constants for cupulolithiasis and incremental time constants for canalolithiasis were determined. At first the CAPs increased and continued for a long time when the cupulolithiasis was generated. Subsequently the CAPs were suppressed by creating canalolithiasis. Finally, the CAPs increased again after the motion of otoconia inside the canal lumen stopped.

	<td>The aim of this study is to compare nystagmus characteristics after caloric irrigation in patients with lateral canal (LC) and posterior canal (PC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and to analyze the role of symptom duration. A prospective study was conducted in 65 patients with BPPV (20 LC and 45 PC) who were subjected to caloric testing. Average slow-phase velocity and nystagmus duration were analyzed. Caloric hypo-excitability was 20.4%. It was more evident in patients with apogeotropic-type LC-BPPV. The comparison of average slow-phase velocity of the nystagmus and nystagmus duration between selected types of BPPV for pathologic, non-pathologic, and the control ears after warm and cold stimulation was not statistically significant (p>0.05). No correlation was found between caloric results and symptom duration (p>0.05). Some patients presented caloric hypo-excitability. Reliability of caloric testing to differentiate the ear with normal and abnormal vestibular function in different types of BPPV was low. No difference was found in the analysis of the impact of symptom duration. Caloric testing is not an ideal tool to study BPPV.</td>

	<td>Recent studies indicate interrelation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's disease (MD). These two entities may have different clinical characteristics. Five hundred thirty patients with BPPV evaluated between 2009-2015 were enrolled in the study. 351 patients who had no clear problem associated with BPPV (idiopathic) and 17 patients with MD were analyzed in detail. The age, sex, site of involvement, type of BPPV, symptom duration, and treatment outcome were compared. Meniere's disease + BPPV was more common in the female population (2/15; 7.5 v 127/224; 1.8, p<0.05). Comparative analysis of average age was not statistically significant (42.82±9.94 v. 40.29±1.65, p=0.601). There was no difference in right and left ear involvement between groups. Lateral canal involvement was more common in the BPPV + MD group (9/17; 53% v. 100/351; 28%, p<0.05). BPPV was ipsilateral to the ear with MD in 75% of patients and it was present before the diagnosis of BPPV in 82.3% of patients. Comparative analysis of cure rate between idiopathic BPPV and BPPV + MD after one session was significant (64.7% v 78%, p<0.05). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo associated with MD presented a divergent picture. It was more frequent in females. Lateral canal involvement was higher. Patients had MD before the development of BPPV and they had prolonged symptoms, which raised a question of diagnostic delay since these two problems were in the same ear in majority of patients. Finally, relief of symptoms required more attempts of repositioning maneuvers.</td>

	<td>BACKGROUND Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common and most successfully treated vestibular disorders. However, there is a lack of predictive factors for BPPV in clinical practice. We aimed to explore several possible predictive factors for BPPV in the Chinese population. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 240 patients with BPPV from Beijing Chaoyang Hospital between July 2013 and July 2016. Biochemical and hematological markers were obtained along with the history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. RESULTS Serum uric acid (SUA) [279.0±84.7 vs. 331.0±82.7], hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) [5.75±1.17 vs. 6.61±1.00], albumin [38.1±3.71 vs. 40.9±4.1], and creatinine [68.4±19.3 vs. 81.5±24.1] were significantly lower in patients with BPPV compared with controls (P<0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that lower levels of HbA1c and albumin were independently associated with BPPV (P<0.05), with odds ratio (OR) 0.680 (95% CI 0.551-0.839) and 0.338 (95% CI 0.190-0.603), respectively. However, the level of SUA was not independently related with BPPV [OR=0.999 (95% CI 0.991-1.006), P=0.713]. There were no significant differences between the parameters of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood routine examination, lipid profiles, homocysteine, pre-albumin, and blood urea nitrogen in patients with BPPV vs. controls (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Lower levels of HbA1c and albumin were independently associated with BPPV. Although the level of SUA was lower in BPPV patients, SUA was not an independent risk factor for BPPV.</td>

	<td>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the frequency of causes underlying the development of dizziness and vertigo in the patients seeking advice and care at an outpatient healthcare facility. A total of 590 patients with complaints of dizziness and vertigo were examined. It was found out that the peripheral disorders of the vestibular analyzer were the most frequent causes of dizziness and vertigo in the majority of the examined patients. These conditions were documented to occur in more than 65% of the patients. The most common forms of peripheral vestibular disorders were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuronitis. The central vestibular disorders occurred considerably less frequently than peripheral ones and were diagnosed only in 10.9% of the patients. The results of the study provided a basis for the development of the algorithm forthe bedside examination of the patients presenting with vertigo and dizziness associated with peripheral vestibular disorders. It is emphasized that such examination should include, besides the standard neurological studies, the neuro-otological tests making it possible to detect the most common forms of peripheral vestibular disorders.</td>

	<td> To investigate the relationship between the recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(BPPV) and the levels of bone mineral density(BMD) and estrogen in postmenopausal women.   A total of 38 postmenopausal women with recurrent BPPV were recruited as study group, in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 2013 to June 2017. Meanwhile, 49 normal menopausal women were included as control. All patients were natural menopausal for over one year.The patients were diagnosed as BPPV based on results of Dix-Hallpike test and Roll-test, with at least two episodes of recurrent onset. In the subjects, BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar vertebrae. Estrogen levels were obtained by testing serum estradiol (E2) levels in early morning fasting venous blood. In the present study, we compared the level of E2 and the value of BMD in two groups by SPSS 21.0. In the study group, patients with decreased BMD were divided into two groups: treatment and untreated group. The recurrence rate of BPPV was compared between the two groups within 12 months.   ①The averagel levels of E2 and BMD in the study group were (16.21±11.00)ng/L and -1.68±0.98) respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the control group (  value was 7.03 and 8.05 respectively, both  <0.05). The averagel levels of E2 and BMD incontrol group were(28.52±6.34)ng/L and -0.18±0.77 respectively. ②The number of patients with decreased BMD in the study group (30 cases) was more than that in control group (6 cases), and the difference was statistically significant ( <0.05). ③ The recurrence rate of BPPV in treatment group [17.6%(3/17)] was significantly lower than that of untreated group [61.5%(8/13)], and the difference was statistically significant ( <0.05).   Recurrent BPPV in postmenopausal women usually accompany with low levels of estrogen and BMD. Active treatment is helpful for their recurrence of BPPV.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common type of peripheral vertigo. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the Semont maneuver (SM) for BPPV treatment, compared with other methods. Studies were selected in relevant databases under pre-defined criteria up to June 2015. The Cochrane evaluation system was used to assess the quality of the studies. Effect size was indicated as a risk-ratio (RR) with corresponding 95% confidential interval (CI). Statistical analysis was conducted under a randomized- or fixed-effects model. Sub-group analysis was performed. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. All of the studies presented a low attrition bias, but a high selection and reporting bias. SM had a much higher recovery rate (SM vs no treatment: RR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.97-3.44, p < 0.01; SM vs sham: RR = 4.89, 95% CI = 3.01-7.94, p < 0.01), and lower recurrence rate than those from controls (SM vs no treatment: RR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.04-0.31, p < 0.01). Overall, SM had similar outcomes with Epley maneuver (EM) and Brandt-Daroff exercise (BDE) in terms of recovery rate, recurrence rate, and side-effects. SM is as effective as EM and BDE for BPPV treatment.</td>

	<td> To investigate the clinical features and evaluate the efficacy of manual reduction in treatment of age patients with secondary benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (s-BPPV).   Thirty-two cases of aged patients ( the s-BPPV group: including 19 cases of female and 13 males, age from 60 to 86 years old)with secondary benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from Jul. 2013 to Sep. 2015 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The results were compared with 121 patients( the primary group: including 82 cases of female and 39males, aged from 60 to 86 years old)with aged primary benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(p -BPPV). All the patients were followed up for 12 months. Statistical data analysis was carried out with SPSS 19.0.   20.92%(32/153)of all the observed elderly patients with BPPV was the aged s-BPPV. The sex ratio and onset age had no significant difference between the two groups(χ(2)=0.79,  >0.05;  =0.37,  >0.05). The rate of two or more semicircular canal involvement in the secondary group(21.88%) was higher than that in primary group(6.61%)(χ(2)=6.67,  <0.05). Bilateral semicircular canals were involved in 5 of the 32 cases in secondary group(15.63%) and 4 of the 121 cases in aged primary group(3.31%), The difference was significant(χ(2)=6.94,  <0.05). The effective rate after first manual reduction was 57.50%(23/40)in secondary group and 82.31%(107/130)in primary group, the difference was significant(χ(2)=10.46,  <0.05). The total effective rate were 87.50%(35/40) after more than once manual reduction in secondary group and 91.54%(119/130) in primary group, the difference was not significant(χ(2)= 0.59,  >0.05). The numbers of circulation of the first successful manual reduction management were (3.9±1.3)times in secondary group and (2.1±1.1)times in primary group, the difference was significant( =3.15,  <0.05). The recurrence rate was 37.50%(15/40) in the secondary group and 16.15%(21/130)in primary group after during follow-up for 12 months, the difference was statistically significant(χ(2)=8.35,  <0.05).   It's shown that the aged patients with secondary BPPV is not rare in clinical practice, sudden deafness and head trauma are frequent more than other reasons. The aged patients with secondary BPPV are prone to injury in multi-semicircular and bilateral canal compared with the primary BPPV. The effective rate after first manual reduction of secondary BPPV is lower than primary BPPV, it's needed more circulation of first success in manual reduction management. The total effective rates are not significant in two groups and recurrence rate is relatively high in secondary group.</td>

HC-BPPV is characterized by intermittent recurrent episodes of vertigo following a change in head position relative to gravity. HC-BPPV prevalence ranges from 5%-33% of all dizziness cases seen in otolaryngology, neurology and family physician clinics. Various factors, such as ear and head injury, can cause HC-BPPV. Cardiovascular disease and iatrogenic reasons are also implicated. Despite the prevalence of the disease, there are various forms of diagnostic procedures, some of which are unfamiliar to the therapist and some are controversial. This review aims to present the full range of methods of diagnosis of HC-BPPV, presenting their advantages and disadvantages.</td>

	<td>Vertigo and dizziness are among the most common chief complaints in the emergency department. Etiologies can be categorized into three subgroups: neurootological (vestibular), medical (especially cardiovascular, metabolic), and psychiatric disorders. The diagnostic approach in the emergency department is based on a systematic analysis of case history (type, time course of symptoms, modulating factors, associated symptoms), clinical examination of the vestibular, ocular motor, and cerebellar systems (head impulse test, nystagmus, skew deviation, positioning maneuver, test of gait and stance), as well as a basal monitoring (vital signs, 12-lead ECG, blood tests). For differentiation of peripheral and central etiologies in acute vestibular syndrome, the HINTS exam (head impulse test, nystagmus, test of skew) and examination of smooth pursuit and saccades should be applied. Nonselective use of neuroimaging is not indicated due to a low diagnostic yield. Cranial imaging should be done in the following constellations: (1) detection of focal neurological or central ocular motor and vestibular signs on clinical exam, (2) acute abasia with only minor ocular motor signs, (3) presence of various cardiovascular risk factors, (4) headache of unknown quality as an accompanying symptom. Besides the symptomatic therapy of vertigo and dizziness with antiemetics or analgesics, further diagnostic differentiation is urgent to guide proper treatment. Examples are the acute therapy in cerebral ischemia, the execution of positioning maneuvers in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the use of corticosteroids in acute unilateral vestibulopathy, as well as the readjustment of metabolic homeostasis in medical disorders.</td>

	<td>Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) is defined by inadequate blood flow through the posterior circulation of the brain, supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries that merge to form the basilar artery. The term was coined in the 1950s after C. Miller Fisher used carotid insufficiency to describe transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the carotid supplied territories and is therefore often used to describe brief episodes of transient ischemic attacks in the vertebrobasilar territory. Also known as the posterior circulation, the vertebrobasilar vasculature supplies areas such as the brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital and medial temporal lobes. Although patients may initially be asymptomatic, the significant build-up of atherosclerotic plaques over time may lead to ischemic events. Stroke may occur either due to an occlusion of the vertebral or basilar artery or an embolus that that may lodge more proximal to the brain. In the emergency setting, VBI is an important diagnosis to consider as many symptoms can appear like other benign etiologies such as labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).</td>

	<td>Vertigo is the allusion of movement, a perception of motion though none exists. It is a sensation of swaying, tilting, spinning, or feeling unbalanced, which may be experienced as self-motion to some versus movement of the surrounding environment to others. Due to highly variable descriptions of the vertigo experience, it is often consolidated into the umbrella term “dizziness,” which is a very common complaint, accounting for over three million emergency department (ED) visits annually. Vertigo can be of vestibular or peripheral origin or be due to non-vestibular or central causes. With regards to peripheral vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause, accounting for over one-half of all cases. It is of great importance to identify BPPV versus other causes of vertigo as the differential diagnosis includes a spectrum of diseases processes ranging from benign to life-threatening.[1][2][3]</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a frequent benign vestibular condition usually managed with particle repositioning manoeuvres, such as Semont manoeuvre (SM). Since few authors have described prognostic aspects of liberatory manoeuvres, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of considering vertigo in the final sitting position of the SM as a prognostic symptom in the outcome of posterior BPPV. One hundred and thirteen patients with diagnosis of unilateral posterior BPPV were taking into account in our retrospective cohort study: 41 men and 72 women, aged 22 to 85 years. All were submitted to one repositioning SM and afterwards controlled 3 to 5 days later by means of an additional Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. The main outcomes investigated were the occurrence of Ny and vertigo in the different phases of the SM, as well as their characteristics in relation to outcome of the disease. Among all patients, 75 (66%) presented both orthotropic Ny and vertigo in the second SM position and 72% obtained a complete resolution of the disease after the liberatory manoeuvre. Contrarily, 17 subjects (15%) manifested vertigo in the final sitting position of the SM and among these, only 7 (41%) completely recovered from BPPV. According to our data, in case of sudden vertigo returning to the final sitting position of the SM, the failure rate of the liberatory manoeuvre was higher, even though not statistically significant: therefore, it can be considered as a negative prognostic factor of posterior BPPV after SM.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an idiopathic recurrent inner ear illness that is caused most often by an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) inside the semicircular canals, in which the otoconia begin to circulate freely after being dislodged from the basic structure. The underlying etiology of this imbalance has not yet been well established; however, a few recent articles have revealed that vitamin D level abnormality in these patients might play a role. Therefore, we conducted the current systematic review analysis to explore potential associations of vitamin D level with the occurrence as well as the recurrence of BPPV disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using different databases to retrieve all of the articles that have evaluated possible associations, irrespective of the study design. Then, we reported different vitamin D3 levels from BPPV groups and control groups to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the BPPV and control groups. We also calculated the effect size of each study under the random effects statistical model. Of the 703 studies that we identified, only 37 studies were found to be potential for our analysis, and of these, only seven met our predetermined criteria. Two meta-analyses were conducted with respect to the occurrence and the recurrence of BPPV. When the BPPV cases were compared to the controls (free of BPPV disease), there was an insignificant reduction in vitamin D level among the diseased groups (SMD = - 2.20; 95% CI - 6.66 to 2.26). In contrast, when the recurrent BPPV groups were compared with the non-recurrent BPPV groups, the statistical analysis showed significantly lower level of vitamin D among the recurrence BPPV groups (SMD = - 4.47; 95% CI - 7.55 to - 1.29). Although a negative vitamin D imbalance has been reported among some BPPV patients, this review analysis failed to establish a relationship between the occurrence of BPPV and low vitamin D level. However, low vitamin D level was significantly evident among patients with recurrent episodes of BPPV.</td>

	<td>To evaluate short-term outcome for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (p-BPPV) after modified Epley's maneuver (mEM). Patients who were diagnosed with p-BPPV between September 2017 and January 2018 in a tertiary care center were included. Patients were treated with mEM. Five follow-up points were set at one hour, two hours, one day, three days and one week. If Dix-Hallpike test (DH) was positive, mEM was performed and patient was scheduled for follow-up at the next follow-up point. If negative, the patient was accepted as completely resolved and scheduled for follow-up at one week. The proportion of completely resolved patients at each follow-up point, recurrence, lateral canal conversion rate and time were noted. A retrospective control group was created from patients treated for p-BPPV between April and August 2017. The outcome of the study and control groups were compared. There were 93 patients in study group. 63 (67.7%), 8 (8.6%), 3 (3.2%), 0 (0%) and 9 (9.7%) patients completely resolved at one-hour, two-hour, one-day, three-days and one-week follow-ups. 1.96±1.60 (1-5) mEMs were performed. Control group included 61 patients. At one-week follow-up a total of 83 (89.2%) patients in study group and 48 (78.7%) in control group were completely resolved(p=0.1043). In study group 5 (5.37%) of patients had lateral canal conversion within one day. 2(2.15%) had recurrence one day later after two-hour follow-up.

	<td>To study the efficacy of various methods of non-drug therapy of diseases manifested by vertigo and dizziness in neurological practice. Referral and final diagnoses were compared after neurovestibular examination of 599 patients (177 men and 422 women), aged 25 to 79 years (mean age 55 years), with various causes of vertigo. Patients underwent vestibular rehabilitation, trainings on the stabiloplatform with biological feedback (biofeedback), repositioning maneuvers in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Severity of dizziness on a Visual analogue scale of dizziness (VAS-d) and balance on stabilography before and after a course of vestibular rehabilitation was analyzed. Before neurovestibular examination, the diagnoses of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (44%), hypertensive or atherosclerotic encephalopathy (35%), cervical spondyloarthrosis (8%), autonomic dystonia (11%)) are often considered mistakenly as the causes of vertigo and dizziness. After neurovestibular examination, the diagnoses were as follows: BPPV (39%), phobic postural vertigo (29%), Ménière's disease (14%), vestibular neuritis (11%), multisensory dizziness in elderly (5%). The effectiveness of repositioning maneuvers in BPPV was 90,2% after the first session and 100% after the second session. After a course of vestibular exercises and trainings on the stabiloplatform with biofeedback, there was the marked improvement in indicators of stabilography and VAS-d in patients with vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, phobic postural vertigo (p<0.05). Vestibular rehabilitation was most effective if started within the first month after vestibular neuritis. There was the high efficacy of complex rehabilitation, including vestibular exercises and trainings on stabilographic platform with biofeedback, in patients with Meniere's disease. In the rehabilitation of patients with phobic postural vertigo, better results were achieved when vestibular exercises were combined with trainings on stabilographic platform with biofeedback and psychotherapy. The results demonstrated the low accuracy of diagnosis of diseases manifested by vertigo and dizziness and high efficacy of non-drug therapy in most cases, especially BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, postural phobic vertigo.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder. Canalolithiasis in the posterior semi-circular canal is the most common underlying pathology that can be treated effectively by repositioning maneuvers. Our hypothesis suggested that successful maneuvers can lead to repositioning of dislodged otoconia to the utricle. Air conducted oVEMP, which is thought to originate from the contra-lateral utricular organ was measured in twenty patients with unilateral BPPV and we compared n1-p1 peak to peak amplitude of the affected ears in 3 separate intervals: on pre-treatment when typical nystagmus was confirmed, immediately after, and 1 week after repositioning maneuvers to assess change, if any, in amplitude. This study showed significant increase of oVEMP amplitude in the affected ears after successful repositioning maneuver that was more significant after 1 week. oVEMP can be used as a reliable objective test for ensuring a successful maneuver rather than subjective dependence on the patient's symptoms, which may be misleading due to a remission.</td>

	<td>Balance disorders, unsteadiness, dizziness and vertigo in the elderly are a significant health problem, needing appropriate treatment. One third of elderly patients with vertigo were diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common cause of dizziness in both primary care specialist Neurology and Ear Nose Throat settings. BPPV presents a specific paroxysmal positional nystagmus which can be obtained using the appropriate diagnostic positional test and can be treated effectively using specific therapeutic maneuvers. This review presents current insights into the diagnostic, pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects of BPPV in the elderly. BPPV in older patients does not differ significantly from BPPV in younger patients, with regard to pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. However, in older patients, its prevalence is higher and it responds less effectively to treatment, having a tendency for recurrence. Specific issues which should be considered in the elderly are: 1) difficulty in obtaining an accurate history; 2) difficulty in performing the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, which should be executed with slow and gentle movements and extremely cautiously to avoid any vascular or orthopedic complications; and 3) the relation between BPPV and falls.</td>

	<td> To determine the susceptibility to visual height intolerance (vHI) in patients with acquired bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP). The question was whether postural instability in BVP, which is partially compensated for by visual substitution of the impaired vestibular control of balance, leads to an increased susceptibility. This is of particular importance since fear of heights is dependent on body posture, and visual control of balance at heights can no longer substitute vestibular input. For comparison susceptibility to vHI was determined in patients with other vestibular or functional disorders.   A total of 150 patients aged 18 or above who had been referred to the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders and diagnosed to have BVP were surveyed with a standardized questionnaire by specifically trained neurological professionals. Further, 481 patients with other vestibular or functional disorders were included.   Susceptibility to vHI was reported by 29% (32 % in females, 25% in males) of the patients with BVP. Patients with vHI were slightly younger (67 vs. 71 years). Seventy percent of those with vHI reported avoidance of climbing, hiking, stairs, darkness, cycling or swimming (84% of those without vHI). Mean age for onset of vHI was 40 years. Susceptibility to vHI was higher in patients with other vertigo disorders than in those with BVP: 64% in those with phobic postural vertigo, 61% in vestibular migraine, 56% in vestibular paroxysmia, 54% in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 49% in unilateral vestibulopathy and 48% in Menière's disease.   The susceptibility to vHI in BVP was not higher than that of the general population (28%).This allows two explanations that need not be alternatives but contribute to each other: (1) Patients with a bilateral peripheral vestibular deficit largely avoid exposure to heights because of their postural instability. (2) The irrational anxiety to fall from heights triggers increased susceptibility to vHI, not the objective postural instability. However, patients with BVP do not exhibit increased comorbid anxiety disorders. This view is supported by the significantly increased susceptibility to vHI in other vestibular syndromes, which are characterized by an increased comorbidity of anxiety disorders.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an otologic pathologic condition defined as a sensation of spinning triggered by changes in head position relative to gravity and caused by an entrapment of fragmented endolymph debris most commonly in the posterior semicircular canal. Confirmation of diagnosis requires experience with procedures that are poorly known by those other than practitioners with advanced otologic training. The complexity in the diagnosis of BPPV inspired the design of a questionnaire-based algorithm that would be useful for determining a vestibular diagnosis and treatment options. To assess a statistical algorithm for the diagnosis of BPPV in a busy tertiary care setting, with the long-term goal of implementing a clinical pathway to efficiently diagnose and treat patients with dizziness. In this retrospective case series, 200 patients who visited the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine for their initial vertigo symptoms from September 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016, were assessed. Use of a validated patient questionnaire as a tool to differentiate patients with dizziness in an electronic medical record review. Linear predictor (LP) value based on the questionnaire for the diagnosis of BPPV. Of the 200 patient visits reviewed (132 [66%] female), 106 (53.0%; 68 [64%] female) had the information necessary to calculate the LP value and had a confirmed final diagnosis. On the basis of an LP value of 0.2 or greater, the sensitivity for a diagnosis of BPPV was 0.75 and the specificity was 1.0. The positive predictive value was 1.0, whereas the negative predictive value was 0.96. Patients with BPPV had a statistically significantly different LP value (odds ratio, 5.92; 95% CI, 2.73-12.83) than did patients without BPPV. The findings of this study suggest that the algorithm is efficient for the diagnosis of BPPV in a clinical care setting.</td>

	<td>Objective To review peripheral vestibular disorders in pediatric patients with dizziness following concussion. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Pediatric vestibular clinic and pediatric multidisciplinary concussion clinic at a tertiary level pediatric hospital. Subjects and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 109 patients seen for dizziness following a concussion between September 2012 and July 2015. Patients were ≤20 years of age at the time of concussion. Incidences of specific peripheral vestibular disorders were assessed along with timing of diagnosis relative to the date of injury, diagnostic test findings, and treatment interventions associated with those diagnoses. Results Twenty-eight patients (25.7%) were diagnosed with peripheral vestibular disorders. None of these disorders were diagnosed prior to evaluation in our pediatric vestibular clinic or our multidisciplinary concussion clinic, which occurred a mean of 133 days (95% confidence interval, 89.2-177.3) after injury. Benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo was diagnosed in 19 patients, all of whom underwent successful canalith repositioning maneuvers. Other diagnoses included temporal bone fracture (n = 3), labyrinthine concussion (n = 2), perilymphatic fistula (n = 2), and superior semicircular canal dehiscence (n = 2). Both patients with perilymphatic fistula and 1 patient with superior semicircular canal dehiscence underwent successful surgical management, while 1 patient with superior semicircular canal dehiscence was managed nonsurgically. Conclusion Peripheral vestibular disorders may occur in pediatric patients with dizziness following concussion, but these disorders may not be recognized until symptoms have persisted for several weeks. An algorithm is proposed to guide the diagnosis and management of peripheral vestibular disorders in pediatric patients with concussion.</td>

	<td>Migraine variant disorders of childhood include benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy (BPTI) and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC). This study aimed to review our experience with BPTI and BPVC and determine the incidence of children transitioning between each of these disorders and to vestibular migraine (VM). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients seen at the Balance and Vestibular Program at Boston Children's Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016 who were diagnosed with BPTI, BPVC, and/or VM. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with BPTI, 39 with BPVC, and 100 with VM. Abnormal rotary chair testing was associated with progression from BPTI to BPVC (n = 8, p = 0.045). Eight (57.1%) patients with BPTI and 11 (28.2%) with BPVC had motor delay. Eleven (78.6%) patients with BPTI and 21 (53.8%) with BPVC had balance impairment. Six BPTI patients developed BPVC (42.9%), six BPVC patients developed VM (15.4%), and two patients progressed through all three disorders (2%). One BPTI patient progressed directly to VM. Most patients with BPTI will experience complete resolution in early childhood, but some will progress to BPVC, and similarly many patients with BPVC will progress to VM. Parents of children with these disorders should be made aware of this phenomenon, which we refer to as "the vestibular march." Children with BPTI and BPVC should also be screened for hearing loss, otitis media, and motor delay.</td>

One hundred ten patients, aged 5 to 19 years old, diagnosed with BPPV. Patient demographics, comorbidities, canal involvement, response to treatment, and incidence of recurrence. BPPV was diagnosed in 19.8% of patients seen for dizziness during the study period. Patient age ranged 5 to 19 years old (mean =13.4 ± 3.4 yr). Female:male ratio was 3:2. The most prevalent comorbidities were concussion (n = 42, 38.2%) and migraine disorders (n = 33, 30.0%). Average time to diagnosis from symptom onset was 178.2 ± 190.8 days. The posterior canal was most frequently affected (n = 80, 72.7%), followed by the lateral canal (n = 37, 33.6%) and superior canal (n = 21, 19.1%), and 36.4% (n = 40) of patients had multiple canals affected. Treatment requiring more than or equal to five maneuvers to achieve resolution was observed in 11.8% of cases (n = 13). Recurrence was observed in 18.2% of cases. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated that patients with vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood had five times higher odds of recurrence of BPPV, p = 0.003, 95% [1.735, 15.342], than those who did not have either. BPPV is a relatively common cause of dizziness in the pediatric population. Children and adolescents with BPPV can be successfully treated with repositioning maneuvers but may be at risk for treatment resistance and recurrence. Increased awareness of BPPV in pediatric patients may reduce delays in identification and treatment.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of dizziness. There is some evidence that osteoporosis is a risk factor for BPPV. To determine the prevalence of BPPV in patients with proven osteoporosis. We examined 187 new consecutive patients who attended our osteoporosis clinic. All patients had proven osteoporosis (DEXA scan resulting in a T score ≤ - 2.5). Patients completed a screening questionnaire assessing the presence of episodic vertigo provoked by changes in head position. When we suspected the presence of BPPV, we performed a Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre and a supine roll test. If the diagnostic procedure was positive, a (therapeutic) canalith repositioning manoeuvre (CRM) was performed. Twelve out of 187 patients had a history of typical vertigo compatible with BPPV. In four patients, the presence of BPPV was confirmed by means of a positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. The prevalence of BPPV in this population of patients with osteoporosis was 2.1% (95% CI 0.8-5.4%). The prevalence of BPPV in patients with osteoporosis is low. Based on this study, we suggest that there does not seem to be a relation between osteoporosis and BPPV.</td>

The subject's 1 repetition maximum (1RM) for the BP as well as the mean (BP ) and peak (BP ) barbell velocities were determined during pre-test 1, pre-test 2 and post-test visits. The barbell bench press throw (BT) mean (BT ) and peak (BT ) velocities were also measured utilizing 35% of the subject's BP 1RM as resistance. The three training visits consisted of 5 sets of 6 repetitions, at 65% of the subject's 1RM. Statistical analyses included one-way repeated measures ANOVAs and paired samples t-tests (alpha level of p≤0.05). The post-test 1RM, BT , and BT  were all significantly greater than pre-test 1 (p=0.002, p=0.0001, and p=0.002) and pre-test 2 (p=0.008, p=0.034, and p=0.015), with no significant differences seen between pre-test 1 and pre-test 2 for any of the variables. The posttest BP  and BP  were significantly greater than pre-test 1 (p=0.024 and p=0.005), but not pre-test 2 (p=0.131 and p=0.069). These findings showed the VST model, utilizing an upper body DCER exercise improved strength and barbell velocity in untrained subjects.</td>

	<td>Selective unilateral vestibular neurectomy (VN) is considered a reliable surgical treatment in case of recurrent vertigo in Menière's disease (MD) because of hearing preservation and a minimally invasive posterior fossa retrosigmoid approach. The present study aimed to assess the quality of life and the long-term vestibular function in patients submitted to yearly follow-up after VN because of intractable MD. Retrospective series of 15 MD patients undergoing retrosigmoid VN for recurrent vertigo. Outcome measures included cVEMPs and oVEMPs (cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials), VHIT (Video Head Impulse Test) and caloric test, besides to DHI (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and PTA (Pure Tone Audiometry). Mean DHI score resulted within normal values in 74% of patients, significantly correlated to the duration of the follow-up. In the operated side, cVEMPs and oVEMPs have not been elicited respectively in 11 patients (73%) and 13 patients (87%), whereas it was not possible to evoke any response at bithermal caloric test in 4 cases. The gain of VOR from VHIT resulted always below normal values after VN except in one patient, who has also undergone an episode of posterior BBPV. The difference between average PTA threshold before and after VN resulted not significant. The vestibular outcomes prove VN to be an effective and safe surgery in MD; furthermore, the unexpected occurrence of BPPV after VN can justify the presence of neural anastomosis between the inferior vestibular nerve and the cochlear nerve, allowing to still perceive vestibular symptomatology despite of a proper neurectomy.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral vertigo disease. The aim of this paper is to review the results obtained with the different specific particle repositioning manoeuvres, evaluating the possible risk factors linked to a poorer prognosis. One hundred and seventy-six patients with a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were reviewed retrospectively, of whom 150 had vertigo of the posterior canal, 20 had vertigo of the horizontal canal, 3 had vertigo of the superior canal, and 3 had a double vertigo. The Epley manoeuvre was used to treat the posterior and superior canals, and Lempert manoeuvre was used to treat the horizontal canal. An imaging study by nuclear magnetic resonance with gadolin was always used in refractory cases. The Epley manoeuvre showed an efficacy of 74.6 and 100% at first attempt for posterior and superior canals respectively. The efficacy of the Lempert manoeuvre for the horizontal canal was 72.72% in the patients with canalolithiasis, and 58.33% in the patients with cupulolithiasis. The treatment of patients with more than one affected canal and a history of surgery in the previous month was more difficult. Particle repositioning manoeuvres show a very high success rate, allowing better results in the treatment of the posterior canal. We need more studies to confirm the suspicion that surgery may be a factor of poorer prognosis.</td>

This study was designed to investigate knowledge of the Austroads guidelines in medical students, neurological trainees and consultant neurologists using a questionnaire addressing both private and commercial licence restrictions related to five common neurological conditions, namely transient ischaemic attack (TIA), vasovagal episode, unwitnessed blackout, first epileptic seizure and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In total, 118 of the 120 returned responses could be analysed. Overall, 50% of all responses were correct. Respondents performed better for private than commercial licences, and consultants performed better than trainees and students. The highest proportion of correct answers was seen for vasovagal attack, and the lowest for TIA. In summary, knowledge of driving restrictions was relatively poor, and regular consultation of the guidelines is recommended. A larger study is warranted and increased education at both medical school and postgraduate levels should be considered.</td>

	<td>Lindsay-Hemenway syndrome is characterised by a posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following a partial unilateral vestibular loss affecting the same side. The syndrome is caused by damage of structures innervated by the superior division of the vestibular nerve and perfused by the anterior vestibular artery; the detached otoconia can cause vertigo in the still intact posterior semicircular canal. The most recent vestibular instrumental techniques allow reaching an accurate topodiagnosis in case of peripheral vestibular failure. We report on two cases of Lindsay-Hemenway syndrome despite complete vestibular failure demonstrated by vestibular instrumental assessment. After making some critical considerations on these findings, we underline the importance of not disregarding the diagnosis of paroxysmal positional vertigo in an established complete labyrinthine loss of function.</td>

Case report and literature review. A 74-year old woman presented with acute vertigo, left-beating SHN and a clinical picture consistent with right APVL. Nevertheless, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were normal with symmetrical amplitudes and the video head impulse test (vHIT) revealed an isolated hypofunction of the right HSC. After repeated head shakings, the supine roll test evoked bilaterally a positioning paroxysmal geotropic horizontal nystagmus suggesting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the non-ampullated arm of the right HSC. vHIT and caloric testing confirmed restitution of HSC function after repositioning maneuvers. In case of acute vertigo with SHN, a complete functional assessment of vestibular receptors and afferents should always be given in order to avoid misdiagnosis. Canalith jam should be considered in case of spontaneous nystagmus and isolated canal hypofunction.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral cause of vertigo. It can be defined as transient vertigo induced by rapid change in head position, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most frequent form of BPPV. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of Epley maneuver and Brand-Daroff home exercises for the treatment of posterior canal BPPV. A total of 50 patients between 27 and 76 years of age who were diagnosed with unilateral posterior canal into BPPV were randomized prospectively into two groups. In Group-1, modified particle repositioning maneuver and in Group-2 Brandt-Daroff exercises were utilized as treatment. Patients were followed weekly. Cure weeks were recorded. The patients were followed for 12 to 24 months for recurrence. The recovery rates at the first, second and third week controls were 76%, 96% and 100% for Group-1 (modified Epley maneuver) and 64%, 88% and 100% for Group-2 (Brandt-Daroff exercises) respectively. The recovery rates were similar for both groups. The average follow-up duration was 18 months. In Group 1, 7 patients (28%) and in Group 2, 5 patients (20%) had recurrence, which was also similar with no statistical difference. It was concluded that both Brandt-Daroff Exercises and Modified Epley maneuvers were almost equally effective in the treatment of BPPV.</td>

	<td>With the exception of migraines, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with preexisting central neurologic disorders (CND) is rarely discussed in the literature. Demographic features of this patient group and the efficacy of repositioning therapy are still unknown. We hypothesized that a CND may alter the function of the central vestibular pathway, thus changing the pattern of BPPV and outcomes of repositioning. In this study, we enrolled 93 consecutive idiopathic BPPV patients and categorized them into two groups according to the presence or absence of a CND. In our series, 31.2% of BPPV cases had a CND. The most common associated CNDs were cerebrovascular disease and migraines. The two groups showed similar age distributions, canal involvement, success rates of repositioning, and cycles of treatment used to achieve complete resolution. The major differences were the proportion of females (89.7%) and a right-side predominance (75.9%) in the CND group. There was a trend of more residual dizziness (RD) after successful repositioning in the CND group, but the difference was not significant. The reason for the female and right-side predominance in the CND group is unclear. We concluded that the efficacy of repositioning therapy was excellent (with a success rate of 80.6% with one cycle and 93.5% within two cycles of treatment) for BPPV with or without a preexisting CND. Clinicians are encouraged to diagnose and treat BPPV in patients with a preexisting CND as early as possible to improve patients' quality of life, avoid complications, and reduce medical costs.</td>

A total of 13,484 BPPV participants were matched with respect to age group, sex, income group, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia to 53,936 controls. In both the BPPV and control groups, the previous histories of osteoporosis were evaluated. Crude (simple) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of osteoporosis for BPPV were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to age, sex, and BPPV frequency. A total of 18.64% (2514/13,464) of the BPPV group and 12.21% (6589/53,936) of the control group had a history of osteoporosis (P < 0.001). The adjusted OR of osteoporosis for BPPV was 1.29 (95% CI = 1.23-1.35, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis according to age and sex, the ≥ 70-year-old men did not demonstrate a high adjusted OR of osteoporosis for BPPV. All other age and sex subgroups demonstrated high adjusted ORs of osteoporosis for BPPV. Osteoporosis increased the risk of BPPV in the population aged ≥ 50 years. The OR of osteoporosis was higher in the frequent BPPV group than in the less frequent BPPV group.</td>

We retrospectively assessed bowing nystagmus (BN) and leaning nystagmus (LN). In PSCC BPPV, 75% of the patients showed at least one of BN and LN, and direction of nystagmus provoked by a Dix-Hallpike test on the affected side was consistent with that of LN and opposite to that of BN. In LSCC canalolithiasis, 65% (48 of 74) of the patients showed both BN and LN, which were in the same direction in 38 patients (of 48) and in the opposite direction in 10 patients (of 48). The affected side can be determined according to the results of THE BLT in 74% (55 of 74) of LSCC canalolithiasis patients, and among them, the side determined according to the results of head-roll test was discordant with that according to the BLT in 20 of 55 patients (36%). In LSCC cupulopathy (n = 85), both BN and LN were persistent and observed in all cases, but we could not distinguish LSCC cupulolithiasis from light cupula according to nystagmus direction in the BLT. Although a BLT yields better lateralization in LSCC canalolithiasis, it may be more useful in predicting the diagnosis and lateralization of PSCC BPPV than LSCC canalolithiasis. 4 Laryngoscope, 2600-2604, 2018.</td>

	<td>Here we characterize persistent apogeotropic type of central positional nystagmus, and compare it with the apogeotropic nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the lateral canal. Nystagmus was recorded in 27 patients with apogeotropic type of central positional nystagmus (22 with unilateral and five with diffuse cerebellar lesions) and 20 patients with apogeotropic nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. They were tested while sitting, while supine with the head straight back, and in the right and left ear-down positions. The intensity of spontaneous nystagmus was similar while sitting and supine in apogeotropic type of central positional nystagmus, but greater when supine in apogeotropic nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In central positional nystagmus, when due to a focal pathology, the lesions mostly overlapped in the vestibulocerebellum (nodulus, uvula, and tonsil). We suggest a mechanism for apogeotropic type of central positional nystagmus based on the location of lesions and a model that uses the velocity-storage mechanism. During both tilt and translation, the otolith organs can relay the same gravito-inertial acceleration signal. This inherent ambiguity can be resolved by a 'tilt-estimator circuit' in which information from the semicircular canals about head rotation is combined with otolith information about linear acceleration through the velocity-storage mechanism. An example of how this mechanism works in normal subjects is the sustained horizontal nystagmus that is produced when a normal subject is rotated at a constant speed around an axis that is tilted away from the true vertical (off-vertical axis rotation). We propose that when the tilt-estimator circuit malfunctions, for example, with lesions in the vestibulocerebellum, the estimate of the direction of gravity is erroneously biased away from true vertical. If the bias is toward the nose, when the head is turned to the side while supine, there will be sustained, unwanted, horizontal positional nystagmus (apogeotropic type of central positional nystagmus) because of an inappropriate feedback signal indicating that the head is rotating when it is not.</td>

Repeated determinations of VOR gain and GA were compared to evaluate the time course of vHIT measurements during CRM treatment in isolated PSCC-BPPV patients, and the values were also compared with the control group. VOR gains and GA values were not statistically different before and after CRM and at the third-day, seventh-day and first-month visits for the affected PSCC. Moreover, values did not differ between the BPPV and control groups, and none of the subjects demonstrated corrective saccades. To our knowledge, this study is the first report to investigate vHIT measurements with a time course of alterations during CRM treatment in PSCC-BPPV patients. vHIT may not provide an additional contribution for evaluating vestibular dysfunction during the diagnosis and treatment of isolated PSCC-BPPV.</td>

Liberatory nystagmus or vertigo after maximum 2 maneuvers. Vertigo and dizziness intensity scores (Visual analogue scale VAS 0-10) from day 0 to day 5 following the repositioning manoeuvre were also recorded in responsive patients. While in non-overweight subjects no significant difference comparing the effectiveness of the two manoeuvres was found, liberatory nystagmus and vertigo were more frequently observed after Galletti Contrino manoeuvre in overweight subjects; this difference was statistically significant when posterior canals were involved (P < 0.03). Vertigo and dizziness VAS scores reduced significantly from day 0 to day 5 after therapy in all groups. A more significant reduction of dizziness VAS was recorded in patients undergoing Galletti-Contrino manoeuvre at days 4-5 (P < 0.005). Galletti-Contrino manoeuvre seems to be significantly more effective than Semont-Toupet manoeuvre in the treatment of BPPV of posterior semicircular canal and may be preferential in patients with limited body movements.</td>

	<td>Canalith jam refers to a condition caused by an otolithic clump blocked inside a semicircular canal, generally provoked by canalith repositioning procedure. We describe the first case of spontaneous canalith jam mimicking an acute vestibular deficit. We report the case of an 82-year-old woman who suffered a sudden episode of persistent rotational vertigo with nausea and vomiting, not provoked by head movements. Videonystagmography revealed a horizontal right-beating spontaneous nystagmus, inhibited by visual fixation. Surprisingly, the positional test showed a direction changing apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus weaker in the left side, compatible with a left side horizontal canal canalolithiasis of the apogetropic type. Returning to the sitting position, a spontaneous nystagmus was observed again, not tilt sensitive. A left side caloric paresis was found. After performing liberatory maneuvers, the spontaneous nystagmus disappeared and a horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of geotropic type was documented. The canal paresis also disappeared. Canalith jam is rarely described and is overall observed as a repositioning manoeuvre complication, not as a mimicker of a vestibular neuritis. Furthermore, our case represents the first observation of a recurrent canalith jam and apogeotropic variant of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</td>

	<td>Many studies have published conflicting results regarding the necessity of post-maneuver postural restrictions following treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The purpose of this meta-analysis is to complete an updated, comprehensive review to determine best practice following a repositioning maneuver (RM). PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched through July 2016. The reference lists of the selected studies were searched for studies that were not identified in the electronic database searches. Studies investigating the effect of post-maneuver postural restrictions on RM treatment efficacy were included. The methodology, number of participants, type of RM administered, post-maneuver restrictions implemented, outcome measures, and results for each study were recorded. Following data extraction, heterogeneity and homogeneity values of included studies were determined. Risk ratios and random effects values were obtained to determine effect size. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of 739 total subjects were analyzed, 362 of which received post-maneuver postural restrictions and 377 of which did not. Meta-analysis revealed that there was not a statistically significant difference in treatment success rates between patients who received post-maneuver postural restrictions (90.3%) and those who did not (81.7%) (p = 0.095). There was no statistically significant difference found in treatment efficacy between subjects who received post-maneuver postural restrictions and those who did not. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, if there is any benefit from prescribing the postural restrictions, it is likely to be a small marginal improvement in outcomes.</td>

	<td>Though there is abundant literature on cervicogenic dizziness with at least half a dozen of review articles, the condition remains to be enigmatic for clinicians dealing with the dizzy patients. However, most of these studies have studied the cervicogenic dizziness in general without separating the constitute conditions. Since the aetiopathological mechanism of dizziness varies between these cervicogenic causes, one cannot rely on the universal conclusions of these studies unless the constitute conditions of cervicogenic dizziness are separated and contrasted against each other. This narrative review of recent literature revisits the pathophysiology and the management guidelines of various conditions causing the cervicogenic dizziness, with an objective to formulate a practical algorithm that could be of clinical utility. The structured discussion on each of the causes of the cervicogenic dizziness not only enhances the readers' understanding of the topic in depth but also enables further research by identifying the potential areas of interest and the missing links. Certain peculiar features of each condition have been discussed with an emphasis on the recent experimental and clinical studies. A simple aetiopathological classification and a sensible management algorithm have been proposed by the author, to enable the identification of the most appropriate underlying cause for the cervicogenic dizziness in any given case. However, further clinical studies are required to validate this algorithm. So far, no single clinical study, either epidemiological or interventional, has incorporated and isolated all the constitute conditions of cervicogenic dizziness. There is a need for such studies in the future to validate either the reliability of a clinical test or the efficacy of an intervention in cervicogenic dizziness.</td>

	<td>Implementation of the "aVOR app" into teaching courses at medical school enhances students' satisfaction with the course and increases their competence in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is often underdiagnosed and left untreated. One problem in teaching the management of BPPV to health care professionals is the lack of simulation-based training tools. The aVOR app (aVOR = angular vestibulo-ocular reflex) works as a bionic labyrinth that simulates the activation of the semicircular canals by rotational acceleration and the resulting vestibular evoked eye movements. In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, medical students at a university hospital were randomly assigned to two kinds of small instructional groups. Students of the control group (n = 67) practiced diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for BPPV on each other, while the participants of the study group (n = 46) used the aVOR app as a virtual patient in addition. At the end of the term, students were asked to arrange the steps of the canalith repositioning procedure in the correct order in a written test. Quality of the teaching media was rated significantly better in the aVOR group (two-sided Mann-Whitney test: P < 0.00001). Significantly more students of the aVOR group than the control group arranged the steps of the canalith repositioning procedure correctly in the final exam (56.3% versus 25.9%, Fisher's exact test: P = 0.006). Implementation of the aVOR app as a virtual patient into small instructional courses is well adopted by medical students and increases their competence in treating BPPV.</td>

	<td>Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department. Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions. The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.</td>

	<td>Making the correct diagnosis of patients presenting with vertigo and dizziness in clinical practice is often challenging. In this study we examined the performance of the iPad based program me x in the prediction of different clinical vertigo and dizziness diagnoses and as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between them. The data collection was done in the outpatient clinic of the German Center of Vertigo and Balance Disorders. The "gold standard diagnosis" was defined as the clinical diagnosis of the specialist during the visit of the patient based on standardized history and clinical examination. Another independent and blinded physician finalized each patient's case in the constellatory diagnostic system of me x based on an algorithm using all available clinical information. These diagnoses were compared to the "gold standard" by retrospective review of the charts of the patients. The accuracy provided by me x was defined as the number of correctly classified diagnoses. In addition, the probability of being test positive when a disease was present (sensitivity), of being test negative when a disease was absent (specificity), of having the disease when the test is positive (positive predictive value) and of not having the disease when the test is negative (negative predictive value) for the most common diagnoses were reported. Sixteen possible different vertigo and dizziness diagnoses could be provided by me x. A total of 610 patients (mean age 58.1 ± 16.3 years, 51.2% female) were included. The accuracy for the most common diagnoses was between 82.1 and 96.6% with a sensitivity of 40 to 80.5% and a specificity of more than 80%. When analyzing the quality of me x in a multiclass problem for the six most common clinical diagnoses, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were as follows: Bilateral vestibulopathy (81.6, 97.1, 71.1, and 97.5%), Menière's disease (77.8, 97.6, 87.0, and 95.3%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (61.7, 98.3, 86.6, and 93.4%), downbeat nystagmus syndrome (69.6, 97.7, 71.1, and 97.5%), vestibular migraine (34.7, 97.8, 76.1, and 88.3%), and phobic postural vertigo (80.5, 82.5, 52.5, and 94.6%). This study demonstrates that me x is a new and easy approach to screen for different diagnoses. With the high specificity and negative predictive value, the system helps to rule out differential diagnoses and can therefore also lead to a cost reduction in the health care system. However, the sensitivity was unexpectedly low, especially for vestibular migraine. All in all, this device can only be a complementary tool, in particular for non-experts in the field.</td>

	<td>There are currently different groups of drugs for the pharmacotherapy of vertigo, nystagmus and cerebellar disorders: antiemetics; anti-inflammatories, antimenieres, and antimigraineous medications and antidepressants, anticonvulsants, aminopyridines as well as acetyl-DL-leucine. In acute unilateral vestibulopathy, corticosteroids improve the recovery of peripheral vestibular function, but currently there is not sufficient evidence for a general recommendation. There is insufficient evidence to support the view that 16 mg t. i. d. or 48 mg t. i. d. betahistine has an effect in Menière's disease. Therefore, higher dosages are recommended. In animal studies, it was shown that betahistine increases cochlear blood flow. In vestibular paroxysmia, oxcarbazepine was effective (one randomized controlled trial (RCT)). Aminopyridines are recommended for the treatment of downbeat nystagmus (two RCTs) and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2, one RCT). There has been no RCT on the efficacy of beta-blockers or topiramate but one RCT on flunarizine in vestibular migraine. Based on clinical experience, a treatment analogous to that for migraine without aura can be recommended. Acetyl-DL-leucine improved cerebellar ataxia (two observational studies); it also accelerated central compensation in an animal model of acute unilateral lesion, but RCTs were negative. There are ongoing RCTs on treatment of vestibular paroxysmia with carbamazepine (VESPA), acute unilateral vestibulopathy with betahistine (BETAVEST), vestibular migraine with metoprolol (PROVEMIG), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with vitamin D (VitD@BPPV), EA2 with 4-aminopyridine versus acetazolamide (EAT-2-TREAT), and cerebellar ataxias with acetyl-DL-leucine (ALCAT).</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of balance disorders in the elderly. Dislodgement of the otoconia in BPPV might have an association with damage to the otolith organs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aging is a risk factor for otolith organ dysfunction in idiopathic BPPV. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 112 consecutive idiopathic BPPV patients who underwent cervical VEMP testing to air-conducted sound (ACS cVEMP), ocular VEMP testing to bone-conducted vibration (BCV oVEMP), and caloric testing. We performed binomial logistic regression analyses to see whether age, the side affected by BPPV or the canal affected by BPPV have an association with the presence of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in idiopathic BPPV patients. The elderly group (aged ≥65 years) had a significantly positive association with abnormalities in BCV oVEMPs (  = 0.0109), while the side affected by BPPV (  = 0.598) and the canal affected by BPPV (  = 0.576) did not. The odds ratio of the abnormal BCV oVEMPs for the elderly group compared with the non-elderly group (aged < 65 years) was 2.676 (95% confidence interval, 1.254-5.079). The elderly group had no significant association with the abnormalities in ACS cVEMPs (  = 0.0955) or caloric testing (  = 0.488). Dysfunction of the utricle, where the dislodgement of the otoconia mainly occurs, is affected by aging in idiopathic BPPV.</td>

	<td>To elucidate the clinical features and vestibular symptoms of patients with otolith organ dysfunction in the presence of normal function of the semicircular canals. We reviewed the clinical records of 277 consecutive new patients with balance disorders who underwent testing of cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs and oVEMPs) as well as caloric testing and video head impulse testing (vHIT). We identified 76 patients who showed normal caloric responses and normal vHIT findings in each SCC plane, but abnormal responses in cVEMP and/or oVEMP testing. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was the most common diagnosis. 37% of patients could not be categorized into any of the established clinical entities that could cause a balance disorder and did not show sensorineural hearing loss. The most common clinical manifestation in the idiopathic cases was recurrent rotatory vertigo with a duration of 1-12 h. The most common diagnosis of otolith organ-specific vestibular dysfunction was BPPV. The most common clinical manifestation in the idiopathic cases was recurrent rotatory vertigo. Specific dysfunction of the otolith organs occurs in association with some of the undiagnosed patients with recurrent rotatory vertigo.</td>

	<td>Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for falling, particularly in the elderly. Due to chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia patients with diabetes mellitus may have neurological deficits as peripheral neuropathy that is a debilitating micro-vascular complication affecting the proximal and distal peripheral sensory and motor nerves. Sensory neuropathy is prominent and represents the chief contributor to postural instability in diabetic subjects. Diabetic retinopathy is another complication consequent to a breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier with accumulation of extracellular fluids in the macula and growth of new vessels causing retinal detachment. Together peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy contribute to increase the risk of falls in diabetic patients, but a certain vestibular organs impairment should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism and localization of peripheral vestibular damage consequent to chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are currently not still understood. Moreover it is not defined the possible role of these two blood conditions in worsening the prognosis of typical vestibular pathologies like "benign paroxysmal positional vertigo" and "Meniere disease". The aim of this review was to retrieve all studies investigating about the balance system alterations in patients suffering of diabetes. A search thorough Ovid MEDLINE was performed to enroll all eligible articles. Fourteen studies comprising a total of 1364 patients were included and analyzed in detail. On the basis of data reported in our review it appears plausible to hypothesize a direct connection among chronic hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic damage and peripheral vestibular organ dysfunction.</td>

	<td>The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the association between posterior channel benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and trauma that is frequently experienced by American football players. Participants were classified into the following two groups: (1) a study group consisting of 63 male participants aged 18-30 years who had been playing American football for more than 2 years and (2) a control group consisting of 49 male participants aged 18-27 years with no history of otologic/vestibular disease or acute/chronic trauma. Trauma, age, total duration of playing American football, and weekly training hours of subjects in the study group were analyzed to determine any relationship with BPPV occurrence. We performed otologic, audiologic, and vestibular assessments of pure sound audiometry, tympanometry, tandem walking test with eyes open and eyes closed, Romberg, head shaking, roll, and Dix-Hallpike tests to all participants. A positive correlation between the total years of American football played and posterior channel BPPV frequency was observed in the study group. In addition, increasing weekly hours of training was shown to further increase the risk of BPPV. A total of 16 out of 63 athletes experienced BPPV, whereas none of the participants in the control group experienced BPPV. All participants completed the Vertigo Symptom Scale, which revealed that vertigo did not cause any significant negative impact on their training routine and activities of daily living. Our results indicate that the weekly training hours and total years of training with American football increase posterior channel BPPV frequency.</td>

Two hundred and twenty-three patients were included in our research and the results as follow. ①The nystagmus replicates the initial nystagmus during the Hallpike maneuver, which suggests therapeutic outcome,128 cases in total (57.4%). ②The direction of vertical component is composite while the rotary component is the same, also deeming a successful trial, 35 cases (15.7%). ③The direction of both vertical component and rotary component isreverse to the initial, which indicates a poor response, 36 cases (16.1%). ④Twenty-four cases (10.8%) showed no certain nystagmus but exhibit horizontal nystagmus in roll-test, denoting that the otolith moves to the lateral semicircular. At this appointment, the horizontal nystagmus can resolute after several times of barbecue maneuver. There is a significant difference of the one-time success rate ( ²=46.198,  <0.01) and the mean treatment times ( =10.048,  <0.01) between cupulolithiasis and canalolithiasis PC-BPPV.

To study the characteristics of subjects with subjective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Prospective multicenter case-control study. All patients presenting with vertigo in the Dix-Hallpike test that presented to the participating hospitals were included. The patients were separated into two groups depending on whether nystagmus was present or not. An Epley Maneuver of the affected side was performed. In the follow-up visit, patients were checked to see if nystagmus and vertigo was present. Both groups of patients were compared to assess the success rate of the Epley maneuver and also to compare the presence of 19 variables. 259 patients were recruited, of which 64 belonged to the subjective group. Nystagmus was eliminated in 67.2% of the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. 89.1% of the patients with subjective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo remained unaffected by nystagmus, thus showing a significant difference (p=0.001). Osteoporosis and migraine were the variables which reached the closest to the significance level. In those patients who were taking vestibular suppressors, the percentage of subjective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was not significant higher. Subjective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo must be treated using the Epley maneuver. More studies are needed to establish a relationship between osteoporosis, migraine and sBPPV. The use of vestibular suppressants does not affect the detection of nystagmus.</td>

	<td>The Canalith Repositioning Procedure (CRP) was originally described as a non-invasive treatment for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) by Epley. Since its inception, the maneuver has undergone several modifications; and currently is performed in the absence of induced mastoid vibration (oscillation). Clinically, mastoid vibration may be used to assist in treatment of persistent cases of BPPV, where a simple CRP may fail to improve symptoms. This case describes a patient with a three-month history of BPPV (right posterior canalithiasis), who was previously treated unsuccessfully with standard CRP. Mastoid vibration was introduced as part of the treatment due to persistent BPPV. After one treatment utilizing CRP with mastoid vibration, the patient had complete resolution of symptoms, and remained symptom free at a six-month follow-up. It can be concluded that introducing mastoid oscillation via vibration to the CRP in persistent cases of semicircular canalithiasis BPPV may produce positive patient outcomes.</td>

	<td>Comprehensive phenotypical data across countries is needed to understand the determinants, prognosis and consequences of vestibular disease. The registry is a data repository for the members of the European DizzyNet. We report results from a pilot study using data from Turkey and Germany. The pilot study included a convenience sample of patients aged 18 or above referred to Ege University Medical School Hospital, Dokuz Eylül University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, and the German Center for German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, University on Munich, Germany, with symptoms of vertigo or dizziness. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ5-D and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). To obtain comparable groups we matched data from the two countries for age, sex and diagnosis by propensity score. We included 80 adult patients, 40 from each country (60% female, mean age 54.1, SD 12.4). Matching was successful. Vestibular migraine (34%) was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (29%) and Menière's disease (12%). Clinical signs and symptoms were comparable in both countries. Patients from Turkey were more likely to report headaches (65 vs. 32%) and to show gait unsteadiness (51 vs. 5%). Patients from Germany reported significantly higher quality of life and lower values of the DHI score. Sharing data facilitates research, enhances translation from basic science into clinical applications, and increases transparency. The DizzyNet registry is a first step to data sharing in vestibular research across Europe.</td>

	<td>The purpose of this study was to investigate the curative effect of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 on the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Fifty BPPV patients diagnosed in the ENT Department of Anzhen Hospital from October 2015 to December 2016 were randomly selected as the treatment group, and treated with 0.25 µg 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 once per day, in addition to the routine diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, 50 BPPV patients in the same period were selected as the control group, and received the routine diagnosis and treatment. The detection results of bone mineral density (BMD) t-value, vitamin D3 and bone metabolic markers before and after treatment were compared, and statistical analysis was performed on the results. There were no differences in the general data between treatment group and control group. There were no statistically significant differences in the BMD and age distribution of males and females between treatment group and control group (P>0.05). The BMD of male BPPV patients in each age group in the treatment group was significantly increased after treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Although the BMD of male BPPV patients in each age group in control group was somewhat increased after treatment, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The BMD of female BPPV patients in each age group in treatment group was increased after treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Similarly, although the BMD of female BPPV patients in each age group in control group was somewhat increased after treatment, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The average BMD of female BPPV patients in each age group was significantly lower than that of male patients, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05) (Table II). The BMD t-value of patients in treatment group showed a decreasing trend with the increase of age (Fig. 1). The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and bone metabolic markers in treatment group were significantly improved compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify whether the treatment of BPPV was effective or not as a dependent variable, and six items, including the sex (female), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, age (>50 years), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and osteopenia/osteoporosis, as the independent variables, and the results suggested that the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and osteopenia/osteoporosis are the clinical features of whether the BPPV treatment is effective (P<0.05). The results showed that the treatment of BPPV with 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 can effectively improve the symptoms of patients, and the level of vitamin D3 and the occurrence of osteopenia/osteoporosis are the clinical indexes of whether the BPPV treatment is effective.</td>

Multicenter observational prospective study. Otoneurology Units of 5 tertiary reference hospitals. All patients presenting with unilateral CSP-BPPV assisted for 1-year period. Spontaneous nystagmus, positive McClure-Pagnini maneuver, positive bilateral Dix-Hallpike maneuver (DHM), positive DHM for vertigo but negative for nystagmus and atypical nystagmus. Response to EM was measured after 7 days in 3 different outcomes: disappearance of nystagmus during the DHM in the follow-up visit, disappearance of vertigo during the DHM and general status (GS) during daily life activities. 264 patients were recruited (68 male/166 female, mean age 62 years). After the EM, nystagmus disappeared in 67% of them, vertigo in 54% and 36% were asymptomatic in their daily life. These outcomes were strongly correlated, but they were not concordant in a clinically significant group of cases; only the 26% of patients met all of them. The healing process follows the next sequence: negativization of positional nystagmus, then disappearance of positional vertigo and, finally, the improvement of GS during daily life activities. Nowadays, healing criteria for the resolution of an PSC-BPPV episode have not been specifically defined yet. Provided that other otoneurological disorders have been ruled out, the next resolution criterion is proposed: absence of nystagmus and specifically during control DHM and disappearance of symptoms during daily life activities.</td>

	<td>Elderly population is frequently affected by vertigo which affects their mobility and makes them vulnerable to fall and other morbidities. Often these patient visit neurologist and are often subjected to CT scan, MRI brain etc. to rule out a central cause of vertigo; whereas majority of these patients suffer from vestibular cause of vertigo. A schematic approach by detailed history, simple tests for vestibular functions like Dix Hallpike, supine roll and head impulse test give important clue to diagnosis. Often the diagnosis is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) which is treated by repositioning maneuver. There are often other vestibular causes which may be diagnosed by Electronystagmography (ENG), electrocochleography and other tests. This study was undertaken to study occurrence of secondary BPPV utilizing various parameters of ENG. The study group comprised of 131 patients from the neuro-otology proforma data base at ENT centre and vertigo clinic from January 2015 to December 2017. Inclusion criterion was male and female aged 51 years and above presenting with dizziness, imbalance, rotational vertigo, unsteadiness as the chief complaint. Exclusion criterion was BPPV relieved after Epley's maneuver, Otitis externa, acute Otitis media, Suppurative Otitis media, pre existing neurological condition and history of ear surgery. Neuro-otology Data obtained and the ENG findings were tabulated in the master chart and the observations interpreted and transferred to Claussen's butterfly chart. The study group comprised of 58 male (44.27%) and 73 female (55.73%) with a male female ratio of 1:1.25. ENG exhibited 36 patients (27.49) to have recurrent BPPV, 53 (40.45%) were found to have unilateral/bilateral canal paresis. Meniere's disease was diagnosed in 39 (29.77%) patients and brain stem pathology identified in 3 (2.29%) cases.</td>

	<td>Several studies have reported the association of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with vitamin D deficiency. This study aimed to evaluate serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels in native Chinese postmenopausal women with de novo idiopathic BPPV and to investigate the possible relationship between the occurrence of BPPV and low 25 (OH) D levels. This retrospective study comprised of 85 postmenopausal women with de novo idiopathic BPPV and 80 age-matched healthy controls. All subjects had bone mineral density (BMD) and serum 25 (OH) D levels measurements recorded, and the results were compared. The prevalence of reduced BMD (T score <-1.0) was significantly higher in female patients with BPPV than in healthy controls (71.8% vs. 51.2%, p = .004). The mean serum 25 (OH) D levels were also significantly lower in female patients with BPPV than in healthy controls (19.1 ± 5.2 vs. 22.5 ± 5.8, p < .001). The regression analyses demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was associated with BPPV with an odds ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.1, p = .031). Our study suggests that low 25 (OH) D may be a risk factor for BPPV in postmenopausal women.</td>

	<td>The cause of Ménière's disease remains enigmatic after 156 years. Schuknecht's rupture and potassium intoxication theory of attacks was based on histological studies. This paper aimed to: present the most contemporary evidence indicating that ruptures do not usually occur, and discuss the possibility that detached saccular otoconia are the main cause of Ménière's disease; and to establish an unequivocal definition of the age of Ménière's disease onset. The paper reviews the electrophysiological basis of the Gibson-Arenberg drainage theory used to explain vertigo attacks. The current, limited knowledge of the likely fate of detached saccular otoconia is discussed. Electrophysiological studies during attacks do not support endolymph ruptures, but rather endolymph flowing in one direction and then in the opposite direction. Age of onset for Ménière's disease parallels that for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The similarity of age of onset spectrum for Ménière's disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo raises the possibility that the two conditions have the same fundamental cause.</td>

	<td>Although repositioning maneuvers have shown remarkable success rate in treatments of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the high recurrence rate of BPPV has been an important issue. The aims of present study were to examine the effects of otolith dysfunction on BPPV recurrence rate and to describe the effect of vestibular rehabilitation exercises on BPPV recurrence in BPPV patients with concomitant otolith dysfunction. Subjects and. Forty-five BPPV patients included in this study (three groups). Patients in group 1 had no otolith dysfunction and patients in groups 2 and 3 had concomitant otolith dysfunction. Otolith dysfunction was determined with ocular/cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP and cVEMP) abnormalities. Epley's maneuver was performed for the patients in all groups but patients in group 3 also received a 2-month vestibular rehabilitation program (habituation and otolith exercises). This study showed that BPPV recurrent rate was significantly higher in patients with otolith dysfunction in comparison to the group 1 (p<0.05). Vestibular rehabilitation resulted in BPPV recurrence rate reduction. Utricular dysfunction showed significant correlation with BPPV recurrence rate. Otolith dysfunction can increase BPPV recurrence rate. Utricular dysfunction in comparison to saccular dysfunction leads to more BPPV recurrence rate. Vestibular rehabilitation program including habituation and otolith exercises may reduce the chance of BPPV recurrence.</td>

	<td>A higher incidence in women (approximately 7:3) and a predominant involvement of the right ear (approximately 7:5) are interesting features of BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). It is speculated that these features are related to sleep position. The first aim of this study was to compare the frequency of position shifts during sleep between men and women. The second aim was to elucidate any differences in sleep position between men and women. The third aim was to clarify the laterality of sleep position. We retrospectively selected the data of 30 males (mean, 53.1 years) and 22 females (mean, 50.6 years) diagnosed as mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea. A position sensor was attached to the patient's anterior chest. Supine position was defined as less than 45° tilt, and lateral position was defined as more than 45° tilt. A single overnight laboratory polysomnography provided the number of position shifts, total sleep time, sleep time spent in the supine position (S), sleep time spent in the right-side-down lateral position (R), and sleep time spent in the left-side-down lateral position (L). The mean value and standard deviation of the number of position shifts per hour was 2.4±1.3 in males, and 2.3±1.1 in females. There was no significant difference between males and females. Twelve cases (40%) were lateral type (S<R+L), and 18 (60%) were supine type (S>R+L) in males. Ten cases (45%) were lateral type, and 12 (55%) were supine type in females. There was no significant difference between males and females. Seventeen cases (56.6%) were right-dominant type (R-L>0), and 13 (43.3%) were left-dominant type (R-L<0) in males. Thirteen cases (59%) were right-dominant type, and 9 (41%) were left-dominant type in females. Body position and the number of position shifts during sleep differ substantially between individuals. There is no gender difference in the frequency of position shifts. Although the supine type is more common than the lateral type, there is no gender difference in sleep position. Therefore, the reason of higher incidence in women is not related to sleep. The right-dominant type occurs more than the left-dominant type in both genders. It is possible that this behavior is the reason for the predominant involvement of the right ear in BPPV.</td>

There has been no study regarding the length of time required to recover the positional nystagmus.

Twenty patients with posterior canal type of BPPV (canalolithiasis of the posterior canal) were included. Dix-Hallpike tests were performed three times for each patient. A second Dix-Hallpike test was performed immediately after the first Dix-Hallpike test. A third Dix-Hallpike test was performed 30 min after the second Dix-Hallpike test. We recorded positional nystagmus induced by the Dix-Hallpike tests and analyzed maximum slow-phase eye velocity (SPEV) of the positional nystagmus. The average maximum SPEV of positional nystagmus induced by the second Dix-Hallpike test (4.8°/s) was statistically lower than that induced by the first Dix-Hallpike test (48.0°/s); this decrease was caused by BPPV fatigue. There was no statistical difference between average maximum SPEV of positional nystagmus induced by the first Dix-Hallpike test and that induced by the third Dix-Hallpike test (41.6°/s); this indicates that the effect of BPPV fatigue disappeared. The effect of BPPV fatigue disappears within 30 min. A second Dix-Hallpike test should be performed at least 30 min after the first.</td>

	<td>To check the value of home particle repositioning maneuver in the prevention of the recurrence of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (pc-BPPV). In this study, patients diagnosed as unilateral posterior canal BPPV were selected following an accurate evaluation using video goggle VNG system. All patients were managed by particle repositioning maneuver (PRM). Patients were instructed to do home PRM once weekly for five years. Then, they were divided into two groups (according to choice of patient to do PRM). The first group (control group) consisted of 144 patients who did not do home PRM; whereas the second group (study group) included 165 patients who performed home PRM. All patients (control &amp; study groups) were followed up every four months for five years. The study found out that the recurrence rate of pc-BPPV in control group was 33 patients in the first year (27.2%), 11 patients in second year (9%), 5 patients in third year (4%), 3 patients in fourth year (2.5%) and 3 patients in fifth year (2.5%). The recurrence of pc-BPPV in the treated side (study group) of patients was reported as 5 patients in the first year (3.5%), 3 patients in the second year (2%), 2 patients in the third year (1.4%), 2 patients in the fourth year (1.4%), and 1 patient in the fifth year (0.7%). There was statistically significant difference between the control and the study groups regarding the recurrence rates in the first year follow up which was the highest in first four months. Home particle repositioning maneuver has the capacity to prevent the recurrence of pc-BPPV. It proved to be more successful and functional in minimizing the recurrence of the disease in the study than in the control group. Hence, home particle repositioning maneuver is highly recommended for one year at least in pc-BPPV.</td>

	<td>Dizziness, vertigo, and unsteadiness are common complaints of patients who present to primary care providers. These patients often are referred to otology for assessment and management. Unfortunately, there are a small number of specialists to manage these patients. However, there are several dizziness disorders that can be successfully managed by primary care providers if the disorder is properly identified. To assist in the identification of several of the most common dizziness disorders, we developed the dizziness symptom profile (DSP). The DSP is a self-report questionnaire designed to generate one or more differential diagnoses that can be combined with the patient's case history and physical examination. This report describes three investigations. Investigations 1 and 2 (i.e., exploratory and confirmatory investigations, N = 514) describe the development of the DSP. Investigation 3 (N = 195) is a validation study that describes the level of agreement between the DSP completed by the patient, and, the differential diagnosis of the otologist. The final version of the DSP consists of 31 items. Preliminary findings suggest that the DSP is in agreement with the differential diagnoses of ear specialists for Meniere's disease (100% agreement), vestibular migraine (95% agreement), and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (82% agreement). Early results suggest that DSP may be useful in the creation of differential diagnoses for dizzy patients that can be evaluated and managed locally. This has the potential to reduce the burden on primary care providers and reduce delays in the diagnosis of common dizziness and vertigo disorders.</td>

	<td>Post-traumatic vertigo, dizziness and balance disorders following head trauma range from 15% to 78% in the general population. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder in such patients. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of BPPV in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and determine the outcome of treatment. A group of 179 patients, with a mean age of 45.2 years, complaining of vertigo/ /dizziness and balance instability after MTBI, was enrolled into the study. All these patients were diagnosed and treated in the Department of Otolaryngology (Medical University of Lodz, Poland) between the years 2012 and 2014. Anamnesis and otoneurological examination were conducted in each patient. The diagnosis was based on the medical history, the Dix-Hallpike test or the rollover test. The treatment comprised the Epley, barbecue and particle repositioning (RM) maneuvers. Nineteen patients (10.6%) complained about attacks of vertigo elicited by positional changes. The diagnosis of BPPV was confirmed in 9 (47.4%) patients: 8 cases with a positive Dix-Hallpike test and 1 with the roll test. In 10 cases, a high probability of BPPV was diagnosed based on the medical history. Eight patients were treated by a single Epley maneuver and 1 patient by the barbecue roll. In 4 (44.4%) patients, the maneuvers were repeated. On the follow-up examination, the patients were not found to have vertigo. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo should be diagnosed and treated successfully in patients after head trauma.</td>

After the ENT interview and physical examination, exclusion of pathological lesions in the external acoustic meatus and middle ear, each patient was subjected to a Fitzgerald-Hallpike caloric test during VNG examination, as well as a VHIT test and Dix-Hallpike test, with the evaluation of eyeball reaction during head rotation. In the group of patients with mixed-cause vertigo (Group I), the Fitzgerald-Hallpike caloric test showed unilateral labyrinth deficiencies in 90.9% of the patients (with the average value of 41.8%) and relative directional preponderance with the average value of 19.0%, while in 9.1% of the patients, the detected values of labyrinth excitability were normal. In the examination of patients with vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was diagnosed in 9.1% of cases. This diagnosis was based on the positive response to the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre and indicative of damage to the posterior semicircular canal in the VHIT test (without signs of deficiency in the VNG examination). The VHIT test and Dix-Hallpike test enable quick and precise detection of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in out-patient practice and expertise preparation.</td>

	<td>To further understand the mechanisms underlying gait impairment following traumatic brain injury. A 58-year-old man presented with marked unsteadiness and motion sensitivity following a severe traumatic brain injury. He underwent a 6-week inpatient rehabilitation program focused on re-weighting and subsequently re-integrating ascending interoceptive information, by gradual reduction of maladaptive visual fixation techniques. We report clinical neurological outcomes and measures of functional outcome, as well as an objective assessment of visual dependency (the rod and disk test) at baseline and after the rehabilitation. Clinically, the patient had gait unsteadiness exacerbated by visual motion. A significant reduction in visual dependency occurred with tailored multi-disciplinary rehabilitation via gradual removal of visual fixation strategies that the patient had developed to maintain balance (t-test; p < 0.01), as well as clinical improvements in gait, balance, and functional outcome. We highlight the importance of visual dependency in the generation of maladaptive gait strategies following brain injury. Our data suggest assessing and treating visual dependency to be an important component of gait rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury. Implications for rehabilitation Whilst gait disturbance in TBI is multifactorial, abnormal visual dependency may be important but under-recognised component of the disorder. Visual dependency can be easily and objectively assessed by the bedside in patients using a dynamic rod and disc test. Tailored rehabilitation with gradual reduction of maladaptive visual fixation can reduce visual dependency and contribute to improved gait and balance following TBI.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a common inner-ear pathology, characterised by episodic vertigo lasting for a few seconds that is associated with sudden change in the head position. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is treated with canalolith repositioning manoeuvres. Intractable vertigo describes a small group of patients who either do not improve with canalolith repositioning manoeuvres (persistent cases) or who relapse after improvement of initial symptoms (recurrent cases). These cases are difficult to treat and may have to be treated surgically.Case reportsThis paper reports two cases of intractable posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo that were treated with intratympanic dexamethasone injections on an interval basis. Both patients showed good control of their vertiginous symptoms, with negative Dix-Hallpike test findings following the intervention. The findings support an underlying inflammatory pathology in intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; intratympanic steroids should be considered as an intermediate option before proceeding to a definitive surgical intervention.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a comorbid condition prevalent in patients recovering from trauma. Due to the paucity of studies investigating the etiology of this condition, the present study sought to analyze the high-risk group of BPPV patients following trauma.Trauma patients visiting the emergency department from January to December 2016 were enrolled. The study excluded patients with minor superficial injuries, those who were dead, and those discharged within 2 days after their visit. The medical records were reviewed, and every abbreviated injury score, injury severity score, and other clinical characteristics, such as age and sex, were gathered. A diagnosis of BPPV was reached only after a provocation test was administered by an otolaryngologist. The correlation was statistically analyzed.A total of 2219 trauma patients were analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 52.6 years, and the mean injury severity score (ISS) was 7.9. About 70% of the patients were men. Additional BPPV patients were identified among patients with injuries to head and neck, chest, and abdomen, and those with external injuries. However, patients with head and neck (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 10.556 (1.029-108.262), and abdominal injury (OR [95% CI] = 78.576 [1.263-4888.523]) showed statistically significant correlation with BPPV in the logistic regression analysis. Patients-not only those with head and neck injuries but those with abdominal injuries-who complain of dizziness need to be evaluated for BPPV using provocation tests.

We investigated the incidence of PN on the supine head-roll test and compared the characteristics of nystagmus in patients with vestibular neuritis (VN) and Meniere disease (MD). A retrospective review of patients, who were diagnosed with unilateral VN or unilateral definite MD between September 2005 and November 2011, was conducted. Sixty-five VN patients and 65 MD patients were enrolled. Eye movements were recorded for 30-60 seconds at the positions of sitting, head roll to the right, and head roll to the left, and maximum slow-phase eye velocity was calculated. PN was classified as direction-fixed (paretic or recovery) and direction-changing (geotropic or apogeotropic). Spontaneous nystagmus was observed in 57 patients (87%, the slow-phase eye velocity of 7°/sec±5°/sec) with acute VN, 39 (60%, 2°/sec±1°/sec) with follow-up VN, and 32 (49%, 2°/sec±2°/sec) with MD. Direction-fixed PN was the most common type. Direction-fixed paretic type was most common in acute VN (80%) and follow-up VN (42%), and direction-fixed recovery type was most common in MD (31%). Paretic type was significantly more common in acute VN (80%) than in follow-up VN (42%) and MD (26%), and the recovery type was significantly more common in MD (31%) than in acute VN (3%) and follow-up VN (14%). Direction-changing PN was more common in MD (22%), followed by follow-up VN (14%) and acute VN (9%). Though direction-fixed paretic PN was most common in VN and MD patients, direction-changing PN could be observed in a few patients (9%-20%) with peripheral vestibular disorders regardless of the duration from the onset of dizziness, suggesting the presence of otolith-related dizziness.</td>

	<td>The patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) may complain of vertigo. Although there have been many reports on SSNHL with vertigo (SSNHL_V), changes in the pattern of nystagmus have not been studied as yet. This study is a retrospective study and aims to investigate the characteristic changes in type of nystagmus and clinical features in patients with SSNHL_V who experienced a change in their nystagmus pattern during follow-up. Among 50 patients with SSNHL_V between January 2012 and December 2015, we identified 15 patients with SSNHL_V whose pattern of nystagmus changed. Initial nystagmus was classified into 5 subgroups: paretic type, irritative type, persistent geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (PG-DCPN), persistent apogeotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (PA-DCPN), and posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The most common pattern of initial nystagmus was PG-DCPN (n = 7). The change of initial nystagmus pattern occurred on day 2 to 75 from symptom onset, and 2 (of 15) patients showed further conversion. The most common pattern of final nystagmus was PA-DCPN (n = 9). Hearing improvement after treatment was not significantly different (P = .59) between SSNHL_V patients with nystagmus change (25 ± 17 dB, n = 15) and those without nystagmus change (28 ± 18 dB, n = 35). In conclusion, clinician's attention is required in evaluating the vertigo symptom in patients with SSNHL_V because the initial patterns of nystagmus can be converted to another type of nystagmus. The presence of nystagmus change during follow-up may not be a prognosticator for hearing recovery in patients with SSNHL_V.</td>

	<td>Clinicians sometimes see patients with relatively persistent geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN) as a variant of lateral semicircular canal-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (LSCC-BPPV). Recently, the concept of a "light cupula" in the lateral semicircular canal, exhibiting persistent geotropic DCPN, has been introduced. However, the underlying pathogenesis of light cupula is not known. We investigated the efficacy of a modified cupulopathy repositioning maneuver (mCuRM), designed to reduce light debris attached to the cupula in patients with persistent geotropic DCPN. Retrospective cohort study. Participants included 65 patients with a persistent geotropic DCPN: 35 underwent treatment (mCuRM group), and 30 were followed-up but received no treatment (No CuRM group). We compared the therapeutic and survival rate of persistent geotropic DCPN between two groups. On Day 1, the persistent geotropic DCPN did not resolve in either group. On the first and second follow-up days, persistent geotropic DCPN was observed in 28 (80%) and 21 (60%) of patients, respectively, in the mCuRM group, and in 28 (93.3%) and 24 (80%) patients, respectively, in the no mCuRM group. The differences between groups were not statistically significant. Furthermore, no between-group differences were found in the time from diagnosis to resolution of nystagmus, or the time from symptom onset to resolution of nystagmus. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the time course of persistent geotropic DCPN resolution from the day of diagnosis and day of symptom onset revealed no significant differences between the groups. Our findings indicate that mCuRM had no therapeutic benefit for a persistent geotropic DCPN and suggest that the pathophysiology of persistent geotropic DCPN is less likely to be a light debris attached to the cupula.</td>

	<td>Poor sleep quality has a number of significant negative effects on daytime function. However, few studies have examined sleep quality in patients with dizziness. Here, we investigated the potential association between sleep quality and various types of dizziness. We examined dizziness and sleep disturbance in 237 patients experiencing dizziness using Korean versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). All participants were classified as having benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's disease (MD), vestibular neuritis (VN), vestibular migraine (VM), psychogenic dizziness (PD), or Other. The mean PSQI and ISI scores were highest in the PD group. The rate of sleep disturbance was highest in the Other group when the cut-off score for each questionnaire was set differently, except ISI ≥ 15. The correlation between DHI and sleep disturbance indices was highest in the VM group. Multivariate regression showed that PSQI score and DHI-E score were significantly related to the PD and Other groups, while the Other group was significantly related to the ISI score. The findings of this study strongly suggest that there are associations between sleep quality and some disease subtypes associated with dizziness. Therefore, it is important to consider sleep disturbance in patients with psychogenic dizziness, such as phobic postural vertigo and chronic subjective dizziness, or nonspecific dizziness.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common type of positional vertigo. A canalolithiasis-type of BPPV involving the lateral semicircular canal (LSCC) shows a characteristic direction-changing positional nystagmus (DCPN) which beats towards the lower ear (geotropic) on turning the head to either side in a supine position. Because geotropic DCPN in LSCC canalolithiasis is transient with a latency of a few seconds, the diagnosis can be challenging if geotropic DCPN is persistent without latency. The concept of "light cupula" has been introduced to explain persistent geotropic DCPN, although the mechanism behind it requires further elucidation. In this review, we describe the characteristics of the nystagmic pattern in light cupula and discuss the current evidence for possible mechanisms explaining the phenomenon.</td>

	<td>The aim of the present study was to examine the association of neuro-otological examination, blood test, and scoring questionnaire data with treatment-resistant intractability in idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patients. We experienced 1520 successive vertigo/dizziness patients at the Vertigo/Dizziness Center in Nara Medical University during May 2014 to April 2018. Six hundred and eleven patients were diagnosed as BPPV (611/1520; 40.2%) according to the diagnostic guideline of the International Classification of Vestibular Disorder in 2015. Among BPPV patients, there were 201 intractable patients (201/611; 32.9%), 66 of whom were idiopathic and enrolled to be hospitalized and receive neuro-otological examinations, including the caloric test (C-test), vestibular evoked cervical myogenic potentials (cVEMP), subjective visual vertical (SVV), glycerol test (G-test), electrocochleogram (ECoG), inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (ieMRI), blood tests including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and self-rating questionnaires of depression score (SDS). Sixty-six patients were diagnosed as horizontal type cupula (hBPPVcu; n=30), horizontal type canal (hBPPVca; n=10), posterior type (n=20), and probable and/or atypical BPPV (n=6). Data are presented as ratios (+) of the number of idiopathic BPPV patients with examination and questionnaire data outside of the normal range. The ratio (+) data were as follows: C-test=21.2% (14/66), cVEMP=24.2% (16/66), SVV=48.5% (32/66), G-test=18.2% (12/66), ECoG=18.2% (12/66), ieMRI=12.1% (8/66), ADH=9.1% (6/66), BAP=13.6% (9/66), and SDS=37.9% (25/66). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the periods of persistent vertigo/dizziness were significantly longer in BPPV patients with hBPPVcu, C-test (+), endolymphatic hydrops (+), and BAP (+) compared with those with negative findings. Although patients with idiopathic BPPV are usually treatable and curable within 1 month, the presence of hBPPVcu, canal paresis, endolymphatic hydrops, and elevated BAP may make the disease intractable, and thus require additional treatments.</td>

Patients admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of vertigo attacks caused by either MD (n = 15) or BPPV (n = 9) constituted the study groups. The control group (n = 10) consisted of volunteer patients admitted to the emergency department with minor soft-tissue trauma. The first saliva samples were obtained immediately during the attacks and the second and third samples were obtained on the third and fifteenth days of the attack, respectively. In the controls, the first sample was obtained after admission to the hospital and the second sample was obtained on the third day. Salivary α-amylase levels were evaluated. The difference between salivary α-amylase levels in patients with MD and BPPV was not significant. The amylase value measured early after the BPPV attack was significantly lower than that of the controls (p = 0.008). Although not significant, an undulating pattern of salivary α-amylase levels was observed with both diseases. An autonomic imbalance could be partly demonstrated by salivary α-amylase measurement early after the attack in patients with BPPV. Therefore, amylase may be a promising marker that is worth further investigation.</td>

The study sample comprised 46 patients with BPPV and 74 control subjects. Anxiety and mood disorders were ascertained via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition/Clinical Version. Personality disorders were diagnosed via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Revised Third Edition, Personality Disorders. Of the 46 patients, 18 (39.1%) had at least one mood or anxiety disorder and 13 (28.3%) had at least one personality disorder. The most common Axis I and Axis II disorders in the patient group were major depression in 8 (17.4%) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in 10 (21.7%) patients, respectively. It was found that major depression (p=0.021), generalized anxiety disorder (p=0.026) and obsessive- compulsive personality disorder (p=0.001) were more prevalent in the BPPV group compared with the control group. Results suggest that psychiatric disturbances should be carefully checked in patients with BPPV due to the relatively high rate of comorbidity.</td>

	<td>The acute vestibular syndrome is common and usually has a benign cause. Sometimes, however, even experienced neurologists can find it difficult to determine the cause clinically. Furthermore, neuroimaging is known to be insensitive.We describe two cases of acute vestibular syndrome where conflicting clinical findings contributed to a delay in making the correct diagnosis. The first patient with symptomatic vertigo had signs consistent with horizontal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo but also had an abnormal horizontal head impulse test, superficially suggesting acute vestibular neuritis but later accounted for by the finding of a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). The second patient also had an abnormal horizontal head impulse test, with skew deviation suggesting stroke as the cause. However, later assessment identified that a long-standing fourth nerve palsy was the true cause for her apparent skew. We discuss potential errors that can arise when assessing such patients and highlight ways to avoid them.</td>

	<td>To explore the value of items for the Chinese version of Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) in differential diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with vertigo or dizziness first coming to the outpatient clinic.  Methods: A total of 322 patients with vertigo or dizziness, who came from Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, were enrolled from April 2016 to February 2017. The Chinese version of DHI and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were completed by themselves. After detailed vestibular function examination, the patients were divided into a BPPV group, a normal vestibular group, and a abnormal vestibular group.  Results: The score of DHI-2 in the BPPV group was 5.52±2.10, which was higher than that in the normal vestibular group (3.94±2.91)(t=3.847, P<0.01) and the abnormal vestibular group (4.17±2.74)(t=4.149, P<0.01). There were significant differences in the DHI-2 among the 3 groups (F=9.870, t=4.515, P<0.01). The score of DHI-item 13 in the BPPV group was 3.09±1.39, which was higher than that in the normal vestibular group (1.97±1.63)(t=4.515, P<0.01) and the abnormal vestibular group (1.95±1.70)(t=5.305, P<0.01). There were significant differences in the DHI-item 13 among the 3 groups (F=16.402, P<0.01). There was significant difference in VAS scores among the 3 groups (P<0.05). However, the t-test analysis showed that there was significant difference between the BPPV group and the vestibular abnormal group (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference between the BPPV group and the vestibular normal group (P>0.05).  Conclusion: DHI-2 and DHI-item 13 should be included in the inquiry of disease history at the time of first diagnosis, which can be used to identify patients with BPPV quickly and effectively.</td>

One hundred and twenty-one patients with positive positional test in the vestibular function examination were enrolled in the Peking University International Hospital from January to June in 2017. According to the 2017 BPPV guidelines, patients with test positive positional nystagmus were divided into two groups: definite BPPV and the controversial syndrome. Analyses of gender, age and characteristics of nystagmus, with or without recurrent dizziness, headache, and motion sickness were undertaken between the two groups, as well as response to the repositioning maneuver.   Of the total 121 cases, 49 cases were diagnosed as definite BPPV, accounting for 40.5%, 72 cases as controversial syndrome, accounting for 59.5%. The proportion of women in the two group was 76.2% and 78.9%, respectively. The average age of definite BPPV and the controversial syndrome was 51.2±16.8 and 51.3±15.7, respectively.There were significant differences in nystagmus duration, spontaneous nystagmus and nystagmus after headshaking between the two groups by chi square test( <0.01). The mean intensity of horizontal and vertical nystagmus in posterior semicircular canal BPPV was(10.2±7.4) °/s and(36.6±17.5) °/respectively. And the mean intensity of nystagmus in the strong and weak side in horizontal semicircular canal BPPV was(40.8±25.1) °/s and(20.7±11.1) °/respectively. The intensity of horizontal and vertical nystagmus of the controversial syndrome group was(7.2±7.7) °/s and(7.2±4.3) °/s respectively. The incidence of headache in the controversial syndrome group was significantly higher than that in the BPPV group,  =0.013. According to the guidelines, patients were evaluated one day after the initial treatment. The cure rate and effective rate of the definite BPPV group was 75%(36/48) and 87.5%(42/48),and was 0 and 30.4% in the controversial syndrome group respectively.   The patients in controversial syndrome group have a preponderance of exhibiting positive nystagmus during positional test. Nystagmus were usually of low velocity and sustained. Most of these cases presented spontaneous nystagmus and headshaking induced nystagmus, as well as headache and lacunar infarctions in history, and the response to the repositioning maneuver were often poor. It may be related to vestibular migraine and central nervous system. The diagnosis of BPPV must be prudent.Both characteristics of nystagmus and medical history should be carefully analyzed to avoid overdiagnosis.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the single most common cause of vestibular vertigo and is characterised by short episodes of rotational vertigo precipitated by changes in head positions like lying down or turning in bed. This study aims to assess useful questions when suspecting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) caused dizziness as well as identifying if a single question can be useful in identify or distinguish patients with BPPV from other dizziness aetiology. A total of 149 patients admitted due to dizziness were included. Patients answered a questionnaire and were investigated for BPPV with diagnostic manoeuvres. Two of the 15 questions were of diagnostic importance. Dizziness when laying down or turning in bed, increased likelihood of BPPV by an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 60 (7.47-481.70). Continuous dizziness duration as opposed to lasting seconds decreased likelihood of BPPV with an odds ratio of 0.06 (0.01-0.27). Vertiginous attacks by turning or laying down in bed together with dizziness <1 minute, are important questions and strongly related to BPPV. Such questions are important when taking a medical history and may help to early identify BPPV, also for non-medical staff, as well as reduce the need of further investigations.</td>

Retrospective observational study. Ninety-six consecutive patients presenting to one of three EDs with vertigo, dizziness or imbalance symptoms documented at triage. Individuals with a clear non-vestibular cause of symptoms were excluded. Proportional adherence to clinical practice guidelines by medical and physiotherapy clinicians, primary diagnosis, incidence of falls, admission to hospital, and referral to a physiotherapy service. Adherence to clinical practice guidelines by both professions was low, with only 25 (26%, 95% CI: 18-36%) and 3 (14%, 95% CI: 4-36%) patients assessed by a medical clinician or physiotherapist, respectively, receiving the gold-standard Dix-Hallpike test. Sixty-four (67%) individuals were given a diagnosis of undifferentiated dizziness. Of the 26 (27%) patients with a primary BPPV diagnosis, only three (12%) were treated with a canalith-repositioning technique, and four (15%) reviewed by a physiotherapist. Adherence to best-practice guidelines for the management of BPPV in individuals presenting to the ED is low, and physiotherapists are seldom involved in their management.</td>

	<td>To identify novel language usage by expert providers predictive of specific vestibular conditions. Retrospective chart review and natural language processing. Level IV. Tertiary referral center. Patients seen for vestibular complaint. Natural language processing and machine learning analyses of semantic and syntactic patterns in clinical documentation from vestibular patients. Accuracy of Naïve Bayes predictive models correlating language usage with clinical diagnoses. Natural language analyses on 866 physician-generated histories from vestibular patients found 3,286 unique examples of language usage of which 614 were used 10 or greater times. The top 15 semantic types represented only 11% of all Unified Medical Language System semantic types but covered 86% of language used in vestibular patient histories. Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms on a subset of 255 notes representing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, anxiety-related dizziness and central dizziness generated strong predictive models showing an average sensitivity rate of 93.4% and a specificity rate of 98.2%. A binary model for assessing whether a subject had a specific diagnosis or not had an average AUC for the receiver operating characteristic curves of .995 across all conditions. These results indicate that expert providers utilize unique language patterns in vestibular notes that are highly conserved. These patterns have strong predictive power toward specific vestibular diagnoses. Such language elements can provide a simple vocabulary to aid nonexpert providers in formulating a differential diagnosis. They can also be incorporated into clinical decision support systems to facilitate accurate vestibular diagnosis in ambulatory settings.</td>

	<td>Objective To compare characteristics between traumatic and idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) focusing on outcomes. Study Design Retrospective chart review. Setting High-volume tertiary otology center. Subjects and Methods Records of patients with BPPV treated at a single institution from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed. Traumatic BPPV was defined as BPPV symptoms beginning within 30 days following head trauma. Patient, disease, treatment, and outcome characteristics were compared between traumatic and idiopathic BPPV groups. Results A total of 1378 patients with BPPV were identified, 110 (8%) of which had traumatic BPPV. The overall resolution rate was 76%, and the recurrence rate was 38%. Patients with traumatic BPPV were younger (mean age: 61 vs 65 years, P = .007) and more likely to be male (40% vs 27%, P = .004) than patients with idiopathic BPPV. Traumatic BPPV was more likely to affect both ears (32% vs 19%, P = .009). No significant association was detected between trauma history and resolution rate, recurrence rate, number of treatment visits, or affected semicircular canals. Conclusion Patients with traumatic BPPV are more likely to be young and male than those with idiopathic disease. Although traumatic BPPV is often bilateral, outcomes for traumatic BPPV may be similar to those for idiopathic BPPV, contrary to prior reports.</td>

PSCO and follow-up care including diagnostic and particle repositioning maneuvers for recurrent BPPV. PRPV, defined as recalcitrant positional vertigo for any reason following PSCO. Twenty seven PSCO operations were performed in 26 patients. Twenty five patients (96.2%) had resolution of the Dix-Hallpike test in the operated ear. Eleven patients (42.3%) developed BPPV postoperatively, three (11.5%) in the operated ear and eight (30.8%) in the contralateral ear. Five of eight patients (62.5%) who developed contralateral BPPV had unilateral BPPV preoperatively. Eight patients (30.8%) developed BPPV at least twice after surgery or did not resolve, qualifying as PRPV, and all but one of these events occurred in the nonsurgical ear. No instances of cerebrospinal fluid leak, postoperative infection, facial palsy, clinically significant hearing loss, or death occurred. PSCO is a safe and effective option for recalcitrant BPPV. However, 30.8% of patients, including patients with initially unilateral BPPV, had recalcitrant positional vertigo postoperatively, usually due to contralateral BPPV. Patients considering PSCO should be counseled regarding this risk to ensure realistic expectations.</td>

Female sex (40.4% versus 32.7%, p = 0.01) and history of previous BPPV (57.5% versus 32.4%, p < 0.0005) were associated with increased risk of recurrence, while history of Menière's disease, diabetes mellitus, and traumatic etiology were not. Approximately, half (56%) of recurrences occurred within 1 year of resolution. A large single-institution study of recurrence in BPPV is presented along with Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival curves. Female sex and history of previous BPPV were associated with increased recurrence, while previously suspected risk factors for recurrence including history of Menière's disease, diabetes, and trauma were not. Remote recurrence is more likely to involve the contralateral ear than early recurrence.

Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with and treated for BPPV at a high volume otology institution using the particle repositioning chair. A total of 610 patients with BPPV were identified, 19.0% of whom had NP-BPPV. Patients with NP-BPPV were more likely to have bilateral BPPV (52.6% vs. 27.6%, p < 0.0005) and Meniere's disease (12.1% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have caloric weakness (40.3% vs. 24.3%, p = 0.01). Patients with NP-BPPV required more treatments for BPPV (average 3.4 vs. 2.4, p = 0.01) but did not have a significantly different rate of resolution, rate of recurrence, or time to resolution or recurrence than patients with posterior canal BPPV. Comparison of NP-BPPV and P-BPPV is presented with reliable diagnosis by the particle repositioning chair. NP-BPPV affects 19% of patients with BPPV, and these patients are more likely to have bilateral BPPV and to require more treatment visits but have similar outcomes to those with P-BPPV. NP-BPPV is common and should be part of the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with positional vertigo.</td>

Education in vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is inconsistent. It is unclear if the evidence has been adopted by UK physiotherapists in clinical practice and no research has investigated this specifically. An online survey with closed- and open-text answers. A purposive sample of physiotherapists interested in VR. A response rate of 67% (100/150) was obtained, from which 20 responses were excluded. Participants had good evidence-based awareness in assessment (79/80, 99%) and treatment (72/80, 90%) of posterior BPPV. Horizontal BPPV assessment awareness was lower than treatment (37/80, 46% vs 60/80, 75%). Differential diagnosis was poor in subjective (20/80, 25%) and objective stages of assessment (34/80, 43%). Thirty six percent (29/80) were able to list ≥3 test precautions with all three nystagmus characteristics described by 29% (23/80). Eighty one percent (65/80) encourage activity restrictions post-treatment. Only 28% (22/80) were aware of practice guidelines or Cochrane reviews in BPPV. External courses were rated the top method for learning how to manage BPPV. Lack of peer support (26/77, 34%) was the main challenge faced whilst learning. Recommendations for improving BPPV education included more external courses (23/87, 26%) and competency guidelines (13/87, 15%). Good awareness of research evidence was observed in some aspects of BPPV management but many areas require development. Translation and implementation of evidence remains poor and suggests changes in education and knowledge dissemination are warranted.</td>

We present 79 patients diagnosed with BPPV between March and June 2017. VEMPS and CDP studies were performed. We selected 67 patients with posterior semi-circular canal BPPV and we compared them with 60 healthy subjects. BPPV group had abnormal cervical VEMPS in 49.25% of patients compared to 16.67% in the control group. Ocular VEMPS were altered in 61.19% of the patients and 6.67% of the healthy subjects. Abnormal ocular VEMPS in patients with recurrent BPPV was statistically significant. There was no significant correlation with CDP results. Utricular and saccular dysfunction in BPPV patients proved by VEMPS is higher than in healthy individuals.

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common cause of dizziness in the general population. It is a condition with potential impact of reduced levels of vitamin D on its recurrent attacks. The aim of this study was to measure the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH D3) in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and determine whether there is a difference in the serum levels of vitamin D3 between patients with and without recurrence, as well as between the different clinical forms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The study included 40 patients who came to the regular medical examination, diagnosed with posterior canal-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo based on the positive Dix-Hallpike's test. All patients underwent Epley manoeuvre after the diagnosis. Patients were classified according to current guidelines for levels of vitamin D3 in the serum in three groups: the deficiency, insufficiency and adequate level. The average serum level of 25-OH D3 among respondents was 20.78ng/mL, indicating a lack or insufficiency of the aforementioned 25-OH D3. According to the levels of 25-OH D3, most patients suffer from deficiency (47.5%). 7 (17.5%) respondents had adequate blood level of 25-OH D3, and 14 (35%) respondents suffer from insufficiency. A significant difference was not found in the serum level of 25-OH D3 between patients with and without benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence. There was a significant difference in the serum levels of 25-OH D3 in comparison to the clinical form of the disease. Lower 25-OH D3 values were found in patients with canalithiasis compared to those with cupulolithiasis. There were no significant differences in the vitamin D3 serum level in patients with and without recurrence. The study showed a low level of serum vitamin D3 in most patients, indicating the need for supplemental therapy.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder, and accounts for 8% of individuals with moderate or severe dizziness. BPPV patients experience substantial inconveniences and disabilities during symptomatic periods. BPPV therapeutic processes - the Dix-Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (CRM) - have an evidence base that is at the clinical practice guideline level. The most commonly used CRM is the modified Epley maneuver. The DHT is the gold standard test for BPPV and the CRM is supported by numerous randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Despite this, BPPV care processes are underutilized. This is a stepped-wedge, randomized clinical trial of a multi-faceted educational and care-process-based intervention designed to improve the guideline-concordant care of patients with BPPV presenting to the emergency department (ED) with dizziness. The unit of randomization and target of intervention is the hospital. After an initial observation period, the six hospitals will undergo the intervention in five waves (two closely integrated hospitals will be paired). The order will be randomized. The primary endpoint is measured at the individual patient level, and is the presence of documentation of either the Dix-Hallpike Test or CRM. The secondary endpoints are referral to a health care provider qualified to treat dizziness for CRM and 90-day stroke rates following an ED dizziness visit. Formative evaluations are also performed to monitor and identify potential and actual influences on the progress and effectiveness of the implementation efforts. If this study safely increases documentation of the DHT/CRM, this will be an important step in implementing the use of these evidenced-based processes of care. Positive results will support conducting larger-scale follow-up studies that assess patient outcomes. The data collection also enables evaluation of potential and actual influences on the progress and effectiveness of the implementation efforts. ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02809599 .

	<td>Dizziness is one of the most common causes of medical visits. Management of the dizzy patient may be challenging both for the general practitioner, in emergency departments, and special clinics, as behind a seemingly homogeneous clinical presentation several very different etiologies may occur. Research of the last two century enriched our knowledge about physiology and pathophysiology of the vestibular system. Much knowledge is now available about the labyrinth being able to sense head motions and gravity, processing of afferent vestibular stimuli, reflectory oculomotor and postural control, or recovery of the vestibular system. Based on scientific results new beside tests have been introduced including provocation maneuvers for detecting ectopic otoliths in different semicircular canals, head impulse test to examine function of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and the HINTS+ battery for differentiation of peripheral or central origin of an acute vestibular syndrome. Technical innovations like videooculography and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials enable us to selectively and side-specifically examine the function of all six semicircular canals and two otolith organs. Pathomechanism of disorders with vertigo and dizziness became more clear resulting in the development or amendment of diagnostic criteria of several vestibular disorders including vestibular migraine, Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, bilateral vestibulopathy. Broader knowledge about the pathomechanism promoted the development of new therapeutic methods like different repositioning maneuvers in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, pharmaceutical therapies, vestibular rehabilitation, and psychotherapy. We aimed to summarize the novelties in the field of oto-neurology.</td>

	<td>This is the first case to our knowledge of a serious adverse event following the Epley maneuver, which is the treatment of choice for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common vestibular disorder in adults. A 77 year old female presented for outpatient evaluation of vertigo at a tertiary otolaryngology clinic. She was found to have BPPV clinically, and elected to have a particle repositioning maneuver (Epley maneuver) performed in clinic. Immediately following Epley maneuver, she had severe nausea and vomiting, with evolving visual changes. A CT angiogram of the brain was performed urgently through the emergency department and demonstrated an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the occipital lobe. After medical stabilization and rehabilitation, the patient continues to have a permanent visual field deficit. The Epley maneuver is safe and effective, and there are no prior reports of serious adverse events associated with its use. This case, in which a patient experienced a hemorrhagic stroke after undergoing the Epley maneuver, is the first and sole case in the medical literature of an Epley-associated serious adverse event. The indirect causation and extreme rarity of this event do not warrant any change to patterns of practice.</td>

	<td>The assessment and treatment of sport-related concussion (SRC) often requires a multifaceted approach. Vestibular dysfunction represents an important profile of symptoms and pathology following SRC, with high prevalence and association with prolonged recovery. Signs and symptoms of vestibular dysfunction may include dizziness, vertigo, disequilibrium, nausea, and visual impairment. Identifying the central and peripheral vestibular mechanisms responsible for pathology can aid in management of SRC. The most common vestibular disturbances after SRC include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibulo-ocular reflex impairment, visual motion sensitivity, and balance impairment. A variety of evidence-based screening and assessment tools can help to identify the various types of vestibular pathology in SRC. When vestibular dysfunction is identified, there is emerging support for applying targeted vestibular rehabilitation to manage this condition.</td>

	<td>People with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) probably have otoconial particles displaced from the utricle into the posterior semicircular canal. This unilateral change in the inertial load distributions of the labyrinth may result in visual dependence and may affect balance control. The goal of this study was to explore the interaction between visual dependence and balance control. We compared 23 healthy controls to 17 people with unilateral BPPV on the Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance on compliant foam with feet together, the Rod-and-Frame Test and a Mental Rotation Test. In controls, but not BPPV subjects, subjects with poor balance scores had significantly greater visual dependence, indicating that reliance on visual cues can affect balance control. BPPV and control subjects did not differ on the mental rotation task overall but BPPV reaction time was greater at greater orietantions, suggesting that this cognitive function was affected by BPPV. The side of impairment was strongly related to the side of perceived bias in the Earth vertical determined by BPPV subjects, indicating the relationship between the effect of asymmetric otolith unloading with simultaneous canal loading on spatial orientation perception.</td>

	<td>Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can have vitamin D deficiency, which is a cause of abnormal bone turnover. Several studies have established a relationship between osteoporosis and BPPV. The World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, widely known as FRAX  (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX), is a computer-based algorithm for assessing fracture risk. No direct comparison has been made between the FRAX scores of patients with BPPV and controls. The purpose of this study was to determine whether women with BPPV are at high risk of fracture as assessed using FRAX. The study involved 40 postmenopausal women diagnosed with BPPV between July 2015 and April 2016, and 40 postmenopausal women as controls. The 10-year major osteoporotic and hip fracture risks were calculated using FRAX and were compared between BPPV patients and controls using Welch's t test and a general linear model. The 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk was 20.4%±12.1% for BPPV patients (aged 72.4±8.6years) and 14.3%±6.5% for controls (aged 71.2±6.3years). The 10-year hip fracture risk was 9.0%±9.8% for BPPV patients and 5.0%±3.9% for controls. The BPPV group had significantly higher 10-year major risks of osteoporotic fracture (p=0.0069) and hip fracture (p=0.0202) compared with controls. Similarly, after adjustment for age, the BPPV group had significantly higher 10-year risks of major osteoporotic fracture (p=0.0007) and hip fracture (p=0.0092) compared with controls. Fracture risk calculated using FRAX was significantly higher in the BPPV group than in controls. Women with BPPV may need early intervention to prevent future fractures.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and clinical significance of positional downbeat nystagmus (pDBN) after treatment of posterior canal (PC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We recruited 77 patients with a diagnosis of PC BPPV, and assessed the presence of pDBN during follow-up positional tests after performing the Epley maneuver. An immediate response to the Epley maneuver was exhibited by 57 of the 77 patients, with resolution of their positional torsional upbeat nystagmus (pT-UBN). Twenty-two (39%) of them exhibited pDBN during follow-up tests performed 1 hour later. The latency and duration of pDBN were 3.2±2.0 and 12.0±10.0 s (mean±SD), respectively. The maximum slow-phase velocity of pDBN was 5.1±2.5 degrees, and ranged from 2.0 to 12.2 degrees. A torsional component was also observed in six patients. The patients with pDBN were much more likely to develop a typical form of PC BPPV again at a 1-week follow-up (5/22, 23%) compared to those without pDBN (1/31, 3%; p=0.036). pDBN disappeared in all patients within 6 months. Our study found transient pDBN in 40% of patients with PC BPPV after the immediate resolution of positional vertigo and pT-UBN. pDBN may be attributed to residual debris in the distal portion of the PC, which can move toward the ampulla producing an ampullopetal flow of endolymph during positioning.</td>

	<td>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of occurrence and clinical features of vertigo spells in the patients presenting with Ménière's disease (MD) associated with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A total of 104 patients with MD were available for the observation. All of them underwent the comprehensive examination that included the audiological study and vestibular tests, such as the Dix-Hallpike test and the roll-test for BPPV diagnostics. A structured questionnaire was used to calculate the average number of vertigo spells per month during the period of 6 months and the mean duration of the vertigo spells; the presence or the absence of changes in hearing ability during the spells as well as the severity of vertigo were determined with the use of the 10-point visual analogue scale. The patients suffering from BPPV associated with Meniere's disease presented with the following clinical features which distinguished them from the patients with idiopathic BPPV (p<0.05): (1) a higher percentage of female patients; (2) a longer duration of clinical symptoms; (3) the frequent involvement of the horizontal semicircular canal; (4) a greater incidence of canal paresis; (5) more therapeutic sessions needed for the recovery in conjunction with a higher rate of recurrence. The frequency of association of MD and BPPV was estimated at 14.4%. Such association of MD was more frequently observed in the elderly patients (older than 60 years) (p<0.05). The clinical manifestations of the vertigo spells in the patients having MD associated with BPPV occurred with an enhanced frequency; their mean duration was relatively short due to the presence of both long and short positional vertigo attacks characterized by the absence of hearing changes during the spells and the equal severity of vertigo (p < 0,05).</td>

	<td>Dizziness and vertigo are frequent complaints of outpatients in the neurological department. Our objective was to explore the epidemiological category and clinical features of patients with dizziness or vertigo in the neurological outpatient department of a tertiary hospital. We consecutively recruited all patients with dizziness and/or vertigo visiting the neurological outpatient clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2016 to June 2017. All patients were interviewed by 4 neurologists and they completed self-administered questionnaires. General physical and standardized neuro-otology bedside examinations were performed in all participants. Instrumental examinations and other related examinations were prescribed as needed. A total of 392 patients, 272 female and 120 male, were enrolled and the ratio of males to females was 1: 2.27. The mean age was 52.39 ± 13.87 years (range 11-90). Elderly patients (≥60 years) accounted for about one-third of the patients. Peripheral vestibular disorders accounted for 54.6% of patients, central vestibular disorders (including vestibular migraine [VM]) accounted for 22.4% of patients, psychogenic vertigo in 64 (16.3%), other reasons in 9 (2.3%) and unknown in 17 (4.3%). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; 30.8%), psychiatric dizziness (20.5%), and VM (14.4%) were the 3 major vestibular diseases in patients under 60 years of age; however, BPPV (27.9%), central vertigo (21.7%), and Meniere's disease (11.7%) were more common in patients over 60 years of age. This study provided a classification and clinical features of vestibular disorders in a neurological outpatient department of a tertiary hospital in China. The spectrum of vertigo or dizziness is different between different age groups and clinicians should pay attention to this difference in clinical reasoning.</td>

	<td>Low vitamin D levels have been associated with and could play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (iBPPV). Since otoconia degeneration contributes to iBPPV and a lack of vitamin D may impact otoconia structure and integrity, we proposed a negative association between vitamin D levels and levels of a proposed circulatory biomarker for otolithic degeneration, otolin-1. Cross-sectional clinical study. Clinical research center. Seventy-nine men and women ranging in age from 22 to 95 years old without known vertigo. Diagnostic. Blood levels of 25-OH vitamin D and otolin-1. Previously, we had reported higher otolin-1 levels in older age groups. The majority of the subjects (83%) had vitamin D levels that were below 40 ng/ml. Vitamin D level was lowest in the young and increased with age before declining in subjects 70 years of age and older (p = 0.005). There was a negative correlation between vitamin D and otolin-1 levels of subjects over 70 (r = -0.36, p = 0.036). Our results demonstrate a relationship between vitamin D and otolin-1. The majority of our subjects had abnormally low vitamin D levels, but only those over 70 years of age showed a negative correlation with high otolin-1 levels. We postulate that a seasonal drop in vitamin D may not be sufficient for otoconia fragmentation and ultimately iBPPV, rather, chronically low vitamin D maybe required to induce otoconia degeneration.</td>

	<td>Among the elderly, instability leading to falls (and consequences of them) is one of the most important problems. The etiology of falls is usually complex, but balance, posture and gait problems are considered to be the most important risk factors. The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) in differentiating multi-fallers from single-fallers. The studied group included 92 patients aged >60 years with balance disorders and falls in their history. The patients were divided into 2 groups: multi-fallers and single-fallers. The control group (non-fallers) included 21 individuals. The SOT was performed on the 1st day (SOT1) and on the last day (SOT2) of rehabilitation. Mean equilibrium score (ES) of 1-3 and 4-6 sensory conditions and composite score (CS) of the SOT1 and SOT2 were analyzed. The falls were analyzed as a total number of falls while performing SOT and a number of falls in all 3 repetitions of both conditions 5 and 6 separately. In SOT conditions 1-4 there were no falls observed. The importance of SOT to differentiate fallers from non-fallers and single-fallers from multi-fallers is ambiguous. The SOT may or may not indicate the differences between the groups - it does not fully explain those differences. It shows only postural dysfunction without indicating any localization in particular part of vestibular organ. The basic diagnostic evaluation in the elderly with a proneness to falls should include clinical examination and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, supplemented with a videonystagmography (VNG), which would assess the structure of damage in vestibular organ. Posturography is of less validity in the differentiation of fallers from non-fallers.</td>

	<td>The semicircular canals are responsible for sensing angular head motion in three-dimensional space and for providing neural inputs to the central nervous system (CNS) essential for agile mobility, stable vision, and autonomic control of the cardiovascular and other gravity sensitive systems. Sensation relies on fluid mechanics within the labyrinth to selectively convert angular head acceleration into sensory hair bundle displacements in each of three inner ear sensory organs. Canal afferent neurons encode the direction and time course of head movements over a broad range of movement frequencies and amplitudes. Disorders altering canal mechanics result in pathological inputs to the CNS, often leading to debilitating symptoms. Vestibular disorders and conditions with mechanical substrates include benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus (BPPV), direction-changing positional nystagmus, alcohol positional nystagmus, caloric nystagmus, Tullio phenomena and others. Here, the mechanics of angular motion transduction and how it contributes to neural encoding by the semicircular canals is reviewed in both health and disease.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is commonly reported after concussion. With the forces experienced at the time of the injury, several anatomical locations may have been altered, causing dizziness. Describe an objective examination and the types of impairment/dysfunction implicated by the results of clinical examination tests in subjects with dizziness after a concussion. Cross-Sectional. Athletes between ages 10-23 were enrolled with a diagnosis of concussion. An examination was completed to identify areas potentially contributing to dizziness, including tests of oculomotor control, the vestibular system, neuromotor control, and musculoskeletal components of the cervical spine. Descriptive analyses were completed to define the anatomical areas/types of dysfunction identified by positive findings of the examination tests. All (n = 41; 100%) subjects had examination findings consistent with central dysfunction. Of these, 36 (97.8%) had oculomotor control deficits; 29 (70.7%) demonstrated motion sensitivity; and 6 (15%) had central vestibular deficits. Nineteen (46.3%) had peripheral dysfunction, including 18 (43.9%) with unilateral hypofunction, and 2 (4.9%) with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Thirty-four (82.9%) had cervical dysfunction, with 11 (26.8%) presenting with cervicogenic dizziness, and 31 (75.6%) with altered neuromotor control. Functional injury to centrally-mediated pathways, specifically oculomotor control, and afferent and efferent pathways in the cervical spine are commonly identified through clinical examination tests in individuals with a complaint of dizziness post-concussion. According to results presented here, a high majority (90%) of the participants demonstrated dizziness that appeared to be multifactorial in nature and was not attributable to one main type of dysfunction. The common pathways between the systems make it difficult to isolate only one anatomical area as a contributor to dizziness.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common post-surgical finding in patients managed for superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD). The posterior semicircular canal has been reported as the involved canal in the majority of cases of post-surgical BPPV, with only two cases reported of lateral canal involvement. The objective of this report is to present a case in which an anterior semicircular canal BPPV response was identified in a patient following surgical management for SSCD. This case report presents an adult with residual dizziness following surgical management of SSCD and vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). During subsequent evaluation of vestibular function, a transient and torsional, down-beating nystagmus was provoked along with vertigo during Dix-Hallpike positioning to the right. This was consistent with BPPV affecting the left superior (anterior) semicircular canal. The patient was treated with a repositioning maneuver to manage anterior semicircular canal BPPV and no nystagmus response was recorded with post-repositioning Dix-Hallpike test. Review of radiographic images, obtained prior to vestibular function testing, showed a hyperintensity in the area of the left anterior semicircular canal ampulla. It was felt this was likely a bone chip from the SSCD repair that was pushing against the ampulla with further mobile debris within the canal. It is reported that BPPV is a common complication in patients surgically managed for SSCD. Posterior semicircular canal BPPV is reported most often, with a couple of cases of lateral semicircular canal BPPV also reported. As far as we are aware, the current case represents the first report of anterior semicircular canal BPPV in this type of patient.</td>

A systematic review was performed using the most important scientific databases. This review included studies published in English in the last ten years, performed in adults, with emphasis on the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV.    To investigate the long-term effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in patients with BPPV and the rate of recurrence of symptoms.    A total of 38 studies were identified, of which only 12 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies stated that VR is effective in decreasing the symptoms, with a short-term efficacy of 84.7%, and 89.2% in the long term in the reviewed studies.    Valuable studies show the beneficial effects of the maneuvers for the treatment of BPPV and their long-term effectiveness. This strengthens the conclusion that this treatment is effective in resolving symptoms and decreasing recurrences.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent peripheral vestibular disorder and is particularly seen among older patients suffering from vertigo. The brief vertigo attacks in and imbalance symptoms of BPPV are caused by freely floating otoconia within the semicircular canals. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the role of oxidative stress, using native thiol/disulfide (SH/SS) homeostasis as a novel indicator, in the etiology of BPPV. The 62 participants in the study included 31 patients with BPPV and, as the control group, 31 healthy individuals without any cochleovestibular disorders. Patients with BPPV initially had significantly lower native SH levels and significantly lower SH/total thiol (TT) ratios, as well as significantly higher SS/SH and SS/TT ratios, than the healthy controls. After successful treatment of their vertigo, which was confirmed based on the results obtained from the second blood sample, patients with BPPV still had lower SH levels and SH/TT ratios and significantly higher SS/SH and SS/TT ratios than the healthy controls. Our results suggest a role of oxidative stress in the development of BPPV, through both calcium metabolism and the direct toxic effects of free oxygen radicals, including the triggering of apoptosis.</td>

	<td>Endolymphatic sac decompression has shown limited success for the treatment of Ménière's disease (MD). We have published a novel technique with very promising results for the treatment of refractory MD: the Endolymphatic Duct Blockage (EDB) with two titanium clips. One of the challenges of this technique was an increased incidence of intraoperative Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leak. To assess the effect of intraoperative CSF Leak on short-term surgical outcomes. Retrospective comparative study in a tertiary care center (61 patients). MD patients who underwent EDB were included. Intraoperative CSF Leaks were documented. Surgical outcomes assessed were the presence of postoperative Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), aural fullness, tinnitus, vertigo spells and pure tone average (PTA), speech discrimination scores (SDS) and bone conduction thresholds (BCT). Data were collected for these visits: preoperative, 1 week, 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Outcomes for the CSF Leak group (CSF +) (n = 22) were compared to remaining patient (CSF-) (n = 39). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative BPPV, aural fullness, tinnitus and vertigo spells. There was no significant difference in PTA, BCT or SDS between our groups at any visit. Intraoperative CSF Leak may cause a temporary non-significant worsening of hearing in the first-month postoperatively without any difference at 6 months.</td>

	<td>Objective To evaluate the prevalence of migraine disease in an otolaryngologic cohort and migraine-related otologic and sinonasal symptoms in this population. Study Design Cross-sectional study utilizing the CHEER (Creating Healthcare Excellence through Education and Research) network for recruitment. Setting Patients were recruited in a cross-sectional and pragmatic manner in 14 CHEER sites between June 2015 and March 2017 (9 academic, 5 community based). Subjects and Methods Patients were included if they were aged ≥18 years and seen for any concern that was not head and neck cancer. Patients with any history of brain abnormality or headaches that began within 2 weeks of a medical illness, trauma, or head injury were excluded. Patients were screened for migraine with a validated instrument. If they screened positive on the Migraine Assessment Tool (MAT+), the subjects also filled out validated and custom questionnaires for sinonasal, otologic, and migraine-specific symptoms. Results Of 1458 patients screened, 235 (16.1%) screened positive for migraine (MAT+), which is higher than general population (13%, P < .001). The MAT+ group was significantly younger (47.2 vs 55.6 years of age, P < .001) and predominantly women (80.0% vs 55.9%, P < .001). The MAT+ cohort commonly reported ear- and sinus-related symptoms, such as tinnitus (70.5%), ear pressure (61.9%), balance problems (82%), facial pressure (85%), and rhinorrhea (49.9%). There were significantly higher levels of sinus burden with higher levels of dizziness handicap, Jonckheere-Terpstra test = 11,573.00, z = 7.471, P < .001. Conclusion Migraine disease has a higher prevalence in an otolaryngologic cohort than in the general population, presenting with a high rate of sinonasal and otologic symptoms that may be due to or exacerbated by migraines.</td>

The immediate treatment responses to the Gufoni maneuver were observed and recorded. The patients in whom the treatment was ineffective were followed up for 4 weeks to observe the outcome of apo-DCPN.In 21 patients, the apo-DCPN was transformed after Gufoni maneuver, and 7 patients developed transformation within 4 weeks of follow-up. Spontaneous remission of apo-DCPN within the follow-up period was observed in 55 patients who were unresponsive to the Gufoni maneuver. The prevalence of migraine was significantly higher in the early remission group (P < .05) and the period between the initial visit and nystagmus remission was significantly shorter in the group of patients with migraine history (P < .05).This study demonstrates that the immediate treatment efficacy of the Gufoni maneuver is poor in positional vertigo patients with apo-DCPN. We believe that the reason for the low efficacy is that the Gufoni maneuver is only effective for some patients with apo-DCPN type HSC-BPPV. In patients with early spontaneous remission and a history of migraine, central positional nystagmus of probable vestibular migraine (VM) or benign recurrent vertigo should be considered for the mechanisms of apo-DCPN generation.</td>

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2013. We established an NSD group (n = 24,624) and an age-, sex- and index year-matched comparison group (n = 98,496). The primary outcome was the occurrence of BPPV. The incidence rates of BPPV in the two cohorts were compared with a 14-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of NSD on BPPV risk. The incidence rate of BPPV was 43.33 per 100,000 person-years for the NSD cohort and 29.33 per 100,000 person-years for the comparison cohort. NSD significantly increased the risk of BPPV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.487; 95% confidence interval = 1.996-3.099,   < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed that NSD increase the risk of development of BPPV by 2.357- to 3.658-fold in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, when comparing different types of NSD, chronic insomnia carries the highest risk of BPPV (adjusted HR = 3.563), followed by organic sleep disorders (adjusted HR = 2.763), sleep disturbance (adjusted HR = 2.506), and acute insomnia (adjusted HR = 2.237). We demonstrate that NSD are associated with an increased risk of BPPV. Relative to other types of NSD, patients with chronic insomnia are at the highest risk for development of BPPV.</td>

A case-control design was used with a double blind approach. Phase 1 included 70 healthy individuals and 36 individuals each with MD and BPPV and Phase 2 included 20 individuals each with MD and BPPV. The age range of the participants in both phases was 15-50 years. All participants underwent oVEMP testing using 500 and 1000 Hz tone bursts and IFAR was obtained. The results in phase 1 revealed significantly higher IFARs in Meniere's disease than BPPV and healthy individuals (p < 0.001). An optimum criterion point of IFAR ≥1.11 for diagnosing MD was found which yielded 80% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The results in phase 2 demonstrated 85% correct identification of MD and 95% correct rejection of BPPV as non-MD.

Retrospective chart review of patients with EVA. Tertiary referral center. A total of 22 EVA patients with a median age of 8 years (6 mo-35 yr) who underwent both audiovestibular and radiologic examinations. Patient demographics, radiologic findings, audiologic results, vestibular symptoms, findings of neurotologic examinations, and laboratory evaluations were collected and analyzed. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. Subjects who had a history of vertigo attack were categorized as "vestibulopathy group," while subjects without any history of vertigo as "non-vestibulopathy group." Of the 41 ears included, 37 (90.2%) had hearing loss on initial audiometric evaluations. Among the 22 patients, 14 (63.6%) complained of dizziness. Of the 14 vertiginous patients, seven had recurrent episodes, five had a history of single attack, and two presented with postural imbalances. There were no significant differences between vestibulopathy and non-vestibulopathy groups with regard to the relationship between the development of vestibular symptoms and aqueductal size, hearing threshold, or age at first visit. Four of the 22 (18.2%) patients developed secondary benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and all patients complained of simultaneous decreases in hearing. Our results demonstrate that patients may develop vestibular symptoms during their clinical course, and all patients with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct should be cautioned regarding the potential development of vestibular pathology. Moreover, the non-negligible incidence of secondary BPPV mandates positional tests when evaluating EVA patients with vertigo.</td>

A smartphone application was designed to produce stereoscopic views of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, which when viewed after placing a smartphone in a virtual reality headset, allowed the user to be guided step-by-step through the Epley maneuver in a VR environment. Twenty healthy participants were recruited and randomized to undergo either assisted Epleys or self-administered Epleys following reading instructions from an Instructional Handout (IH). All participants were filmed and two expert Otologists reviewed the videos, assigning each participant a score (out of 10) for performance on each step. Participants rated their perceived workload by completing a validated task-load questionnaire (NASA Task Load Index) and averages for both groups were calculated. Twenty participants were evaluated with average age 26.4±7.12years old in the VREMS group and 26.1±7.72 in the IH group. The VR assisted group achieved an average score of 7.78±0.99 compared to 6.65±1.72 in the IH group. This result was statistically significant with p=0.0001 and side dominance did not appear to play a factor. Analyzing each step of the Epley maneuver demonstrated that assisted Epleys were done more accurately with statically significant results in steps 2-4. Results of the NASA-TLX scores were variable with no significant findings. We have developed and demonstrated face validity for VREMS through our randomized controlled trial. The VREMS platform is promising technology, which may improve the accuracy and effectiveness of home Epley treatments. N/A.</td>

A retrospective observational study of 500 patients with posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, diagnosed and treated by the senior author over a 10-year period. Most patients underwent an MRI brain and inner ear, following the same scan protocol. This included T1 weighted sagittal IR-FSPGR volume, axial T2 weighted, gradient echo T2 weighted and FLAIR sequences plus time of flight cerebral angiography. The average age of presentation was 56 years; with the overall female to male ratio was 1.6:1, which was largely the net results of 2 age groups. Over 30% of our patients recalled distinct aetiological triggers, of which the top 3 were trauma, infection, and surgery. These accounted for 16%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. More than 25% of the patients were discovered to have abnormal intracranial findings on MRI. The 2 most common non-infarct incidental findings were neoplasia and vascular abnormalities. Although fewer than 20 patients had acute intracranial haemorrhage or malignant tumours, most of them were urgently referred to neurosurgeon due to the life-threatening nature of the condition. One round of particle repositioning manoeuver was successful in treating 84% of the patients, and the 2-year recurrence rate was only 2.2%. The diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is thought to be relatively easy to make, and the treatment is highly effective. Clinicians should be fully aware of and prepared for the diverse aetiology, and thus have no hesitation in requesting MRI scan as an important investigation.</td>

	<td>Objective - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of recurrent vertigo. Inflammation is a hypothetic etiological factor in BPPV. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory biomarker levels in BPPV patients and compare these with the healthy subjects. Materials and methods - This prospective case-control study was conducted with 114 newly diagnosed BPPV patients and age- and sex- matched 83 healthy subjects. The laboratory investigations included serum hemogram, full biochemistry profiles, vitamin levels, thyroid hormone profiles, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte to HDL-cholesterol ratio (MHR) values were calculated and compared between the patients and healthy subjects. Results - The mean age was 39.1 ± 12.4 years for patients, and 37.0 ± 11.9 for controls. Vitamin B12, hematocrit (Hct), creatinine, urea, and fT4 values, lymphocyte, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin levels were significantly lower in BPPV patients (p ˂ 0.05), while HDL, SGOT, and ESR values were significantly higher. In the BPPV patients the mean NLR, PLR, and mean platelet volume (MPV) values were significantly higher than in the control subjects. Neutrophil, platelet, monocyte, MHR, and CRP values were similar in both groups (p ˃ 0.05). Conclusion - Our result suggests that NLR, PLR, MPV, ESR, and bilirubin levels should be taken into account as potential biomarkers of BPPV. As they are inexpensive parameters and widely available, they can be used in clinical practice for prediction of BPPV. However, further large-scale studies are required to confirm this relationship.</td>

Retrospective chart review of patients seen in a tertiary otologic practice between 2004 and 2016 who had undergone caloric testing with water irrigation and had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine (n=34). A group of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (n=10) were used as a control group. Patients were grouped into quartiles based on total eye speed. Only patients in the lowest quartile (total eye speed<79) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine. All other quartiles included a mix of control and vestibular migraine patients. Low total eye speed may be suggestive of a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, but most patients with vestibular migraine do not have low total eye speed.</td>

	<td> To ananlyze the characteristics of the vestibular evoked myogenic action potential of patients with residual dizziness after successful canalith repositioning procedures(CRP)for idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo(IBPPV).  Ninety-seven consecutive patients with IBPPV of the unilateral posterior semicircular canal and health controls were initially enrolled. The patients received 500 Hz tone burst evoked ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials(oVEMP) and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP). After successfully CRP, the patients were divided into two groups: group with residual symptoms and group without residual symptoms. The abnormality of results of both oVEMP and cVEMP were compared between three groups. In the group with residual symptoms, the abnormal rate were 64.5% for oVEMP and 28.1% for cVEMP. In the group without residual symptoms, the abnormal rate were 17.9% for oVEMP and 12.5% for cVEMP. The abnormal rate of oVEMP in the group with residual symptoms was significantly higher than that in the group without residual symptoms(χ²=19.228,  =0.000). However, there was no significant difference in the abnormal rate of cVEMP between these two groups(χ²=3.342,  =0.068).  In patients with IBPPV underwent successful CRP,the occurrence of residual symptoms is correlated to the abnormalities of oVEMP. It is indicated that the dysfunction of the utricle is related to the presence of residual symptoms after the CRP for IBPPV.</td>

	<td>To evaluate the prevalence and management of residual symptoms in recovered BPPV patients. We performed a retrospective study on BPPV patients of any of the three semicircular canals. Exclusion criteria were multiple-canal BPPV, refractory BPPV, central nervous system pathologies or other vestibular diseases. Patients were treated with repositioning maneuvers until the vertigo disappeared and evaluated for symptoms of instability at 1 month after resolution. A dynamic computerized posturography was then performed on every patient complaining of residual instability. We analyzed demographic data, the affected semicircular canal, number of repositioning maneuvers, presence of anxiety disorders, and we correlated these variables with the presence of residual disequilibrium 1 month after vertigo resolution. We included 361 patients. Residual disequilibrium was found in 107 patients (29.6%) with no significant difference between the rates associated with the three semicircular canals (p = 0.73). The group who needed more than one repositioning maneuver (1 maneuver-229 patients, ≥ 2maneuvers-132 patients) showed a significantly higher prevalence of instability (17.9 vs. 50%; p < 0.0001). 47.2% of the patients with anxiety disorders presented with instability symptoms (p = 0,01). Patients older than 65 showed a significantly higher percentage of residual symptoms (23.3 vs. 34.8%; p = 0.03). Persistence of residual symptoms 1 month after the acute BPPV can be associated with certain risk factors that should be taken into consideration (age, number of repositioning maneuvers needed, anxiety and/or depressive disorders). These patients could benefit of treatment with vestibular rehabilitation.</td>

	<td>Some patients still complain of residual dizziness after successful canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Previous study found that compared to the low-dose betahistine, the high-dose betahistine could yield better efficacy in treating residual dizziness. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess whether the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could make low-dose betahistine produce similar results to high-dose betahistine in treating residual dizziness. The recruited patients were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose betahistine (6 mg/time, three times/day) or high-dose betahistine (12 mg/time, three times/day). Patients in the low-dose group also received CBT (twice a week, 1 hour per time). The treatment was continued for 4 weeks. The duration of residual dizziness, 25-item Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were recorded and analyzed. The duration of residual dizziness and DHI score were the primary outcomes, and the HARS and HDRS scores were the secondary outcomes. Each group had 50 patients. After treatment, the average DHI scores, HDRS scores, and HARS scores were significantly decreased in both groups. The duration of residual dizziness and average DHI score were nonsignificantly different ( =0.08;  =0.06) between the two groups, although they were lower in the low-dose group. Compared to the high-dose group, the low-dose group had the significantly lower average HDRS score ( =0.007) and HARS score ( =0.02). Meanwhile, four patients in the high-dose group experienced intolerable stomach upset. These results demonstrated that the addition of CBT could make low-dose beta-histine produce similar results to high-dose betahistine in treating residual dizziness. Moreover, the low-dose betahistine plus CBT showed some advantages over high-dose betahistine in relieving depressive and anxiety symptoms and should be further explored.</td>

This study is aimed to quantitatively measure sleep quality in BPPV patients and correlate it with the recurrence of BPPV. In this longitudinal cohort study, the clinical records of 67 elderly or middle-aged adult patients who were diagnosed with BPPV at Neurology Clinic, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University between 2013 and 2014. The 'recurrent' and 'non-recurrent' BPPV were respectively defined. Primary data collection included the medical history, blood test and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measurement. Among the total 67 patients after successful treatment, recurrent BPPV is observed in 37.31% patients (n = 25) within 2 years. Among all 11 variables analyzed between recurrent and non-recurrent groups, only the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores showed significant difference (p<.001). In details, these differences were also measured in five individual sleep items, including the subjective assessment of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, the use of sleep-aid medication and daytime dysfunctions (all p<.05). Regression analysis showed patients with higher PSQI score (lower sleep quality) had higher risk of BPPV recurrence [odds ratio (OR)=1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.32, p=.0082]. The sleep quality in patients with BPPV recurrence is significantly poorer compared to non-recurrent patients. Our result suggested sleep quality as measured by PSQI is an independent risk factor of BPPV recurrence.</td>

	<td>To investigate the possible effects of anxiety and/or depression symptoms on the treatment outcomes and recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This is a retrospective study conducted at a single institution. 142 consecutive patients diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV at the Department of Otology in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University between October 2016 and July 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. 127 patients were finally included in this study. Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used to evaluate the presence of anxiety and/or depression, respectively, in our BPPV patients. A significant score (at or above 50 for SAS and 53 for SDS) represents the presence of clinically significant symptoms. Two-tailed Student's  -test, χ  test, and logistic regression analysis were used as appropriate. A   value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The prevalence of anxiety and/or depression symptoms in BPPV patients in the present study was 49.61%. The effectiveness of the first time canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM) was 70.08%. With weekly follow-up treatments of CRM, the success rate increased to 97.64% by 1 month. The total recurrence rate at 6-month follow-up post-cure was 14.17%. Holding all other variables constant, patients with psychiatric symptoms (Relative-risk ratio: 3.160;   = 0.027) and patients with non-posterior semicircular canal (PSC) involvement (Relative-risk ratio: 7.828,   = 0.013) were more likely to experience residual dizziness (RD) even after effective CRM treatment. Psychiatric symptoms (Relative-risk ratio: 6.543;   = 0.001) and female gender (Relative-risk ratio: 4.563;   = 0.010) are risk factors for the failure of first time CRM. In addition, BPPV patients with psychiatric symptoms (Odds ratio: 9.184,   = 0.008) were significantly more likely to experience recurrences within the first 6 months after a successful maneuver. Anxiety-depression status significantly reduced the efficacy of the first time CRM and increased the risk for recurrence. Other factors, such as female gender and non-PSC involvement are also susceptible risk factors for BPPV patients to require multiple treatments and experience delayed recovery. A screening for psychiatric symptoms in BPPV patients and active treatment of these symptoms would benefit both physicians and patients in understanding and improving the prognosis of the disease and treatment options.</td>

HSC-Can patients were induced a horizontal nystagmus with Roll test, the nystagmus intensity of the disease and healthy side were (41.3±20.1)°/s (mean standard deviation)and(21.9±9.4)°/s respectively, the difference was statistically significant ( =6.709,  <0.05). HSC-Cup patients were induced a horizontal nystagmus that was opposite to the direction of the Roll test, the nystagmus intensity of the disease and the healthy side were (12.9±6.4)°/s and(29.1±9.3)°/s respectively, with significant difference ( =9.066,  <0.05). Among 124 cases of HSC-Can patients, 120 cases of horizontal nystagmus were recorded in the left and right sides of the Dix-Hallpike test in the same direction as the turning direction, the horizontal nystagmus intensity of the disease and the healthy sides were (15.1±10.0)°/s and(9.4±7.4)°/s respectively, the difference was statistically significant ( =2.365,  <0.05). And 40 cases of HSC-Cup patients were recorded at the head of the Dix-Hallpike test in the opposite direction to the horizontal eye earthquake.The horizontal nystagmus intensity of the disease and the healthy side were (5.3±2.8)°/s and(13.9±4.4)°/s respectively, the difference was statistically significant ( =10.579,  <0.05).   Characteristic horizontal nystagmus can be induced by HSC-Cup in both roll test and Dix-Hallpike test. Preliminary localization of Dix-Hallpike Test can also be used for HSC-Cup.</td>

A VI was shown in 51.5% of the children tested (1,304/2,528). For BD (e.g., vertigo, dizziness, instability, delay in posturomotor development), VI was found in 36.5% (    = 379/1,037). The most frequent causes of BD with VI included inner ear malformation (13.5%), delay in posturomotor development (13.4%), hearing loss revealed with vertigo (3.9%), trauma (3.9%), vestibular neuritis (3.3%), meningitis (2.5%), Meniere-like syndrome (1.1%), BPPV posttrauma (1%), labyrinthitis (0.4%), and unknown etiology (19.6%). Normal responses to the complete battery of tests (    = 658, 63.5%) excluded a vestibular origin to BD, leading to other diagnoses: principally migraine (15.6%), ophthalmological disorders (15.1%), neurological disorders (including delay in posturomotor development; 14.4%), orthostatic hypotension, or somatoform dizziness (<1%). Of the children referred for hearing loss (    = 1,491), 68.5% were tested without cochlear implantation (CI;    = 1,022). In this group, 54.5% presented with VI (    = 557). This was mostly found in cytomegalovirus infection, inner ear malformation, and genetic syndromes. Profound hearing loss candidates for cochlear implants had complete bilateral vestibular loss in 20% and delay in posturomotor development, and 80% had partial or normal vestibular function and normal posturomotor development. VI was found after CI in 50% on the side of the implant (partial in 41% and complete in 9%). VI is present in 36.5% of children referred to our center for BDs and 54.5% for hearing loss. Vestibular testing permits ruling out peripheral VI and hence seeking other causes for BDs such as migraine and ophthalmological disorders and also helps lower the risk of inducing bilateral complete vestibular loss in CI protocols.</td>

	<td> Several studies have suggested a probable association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and both reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) and serum vitamin D levels, but none of these studies have explored their findings by examining bone turnover markers (BTM) in male idiopathic BPPV patients. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMD and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D), with the occurrence of BPPV along with the characteristics of bone metabolism in male idiopathic BPPV patients.   This retrospective study comprised 60 male idiopathic BPPV patients and 92 age-matched healthy controls referred to Ningbo No.2 Hospital during the period of February 2016 to February 2018. All subjects' serum levels of 25(OH) D, bone formation marker amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), and bone resorption marker β-isomerized carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) were measured. BMD was determined by dual energy X-ray absorption at the lumbar spine and hip.   Among male patients with BPPV, the prevalence of BMD reduction was 35.0%, which was similar to that of 27.2% in healthy controls. There were significant differences in the mean serum 25(OH) D level and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between the two groups, with  -values of 0.049 and 0.009, respectively. The bone turnover markers of PINP and β-CTX in BPPV patients were lower than those in healthy controls. Logistic regression showed that vitamin D deficiency were associated with BPPV with an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.25-11.73).   Our study found that decreased serum vitamin D may be a risk factor for BPPV in male patients. The level of bone turnover among male patients with BPPV was lower than that among healthy controls.</td>

The clinical data from this subgroup of patients were retrospectively analyzed.   The upbeat and torsional nystagmus of 14 patients were all evoked by D-H test in the affected side. 11 cases were right PC-BPPV and 3 cases were left PC-BPPV. Among these 14 patients, 5 patients exhibited the upbeat and torsional nystagmus during D-H test in the non-affected side, which was in the same direction as that evoked in the affected side. Among them, 4 cases were right PC-BPPV and 1 case was left PC-BPPV. However, the downbeat nystagmus of the remaining 9 patients were evoked by D-H test in the non-affected side, in which 7 cases were right PC-BPPV and 2 cases were left PC-BPPV.The nystagmus and vertigo of all patients completely disappeared after performing the Epley or Semont repositioning maneuvers on the affected side.   The bilateral positive nystagmus of unilateral PC-BPPV can be evoked by D-H test. The form of nystagmus on the non-affected side is related with the initial position of otoconia in affected semicircular canal and the moving direction of otoconia during the positional test. It is effective to perform Epley or Semont repositioning maneuvers on the affected side. Meanwhile, both the effect of maneuvers and the type of nystagmus evoked by D-H test can verify which side is affected.</td>

Dizziness is resulted from various causes, and BPPV is the most common reason. Vertigo caused by cerebrovascular diseases appears to gradually increase along with age. PPPD is very common in clinical practice, so clinicians needs to be highly aware of BPPV and PPPD. Although those dizziness diseases have a low incidence, they should not be ignored.

	<td>Otoconia-related vertigo and balance deficits, particularly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), are common. Our recent studies in humans show that, while BPPV prevalence greatly increases with age in both genders, peri-menopausal women are especially susceptible. In the present study, we show that bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) mice have significant balance behavioral deficits, and that estrogen deficiency compromises otoconia maintenance and anchoring by reducing the expression of otoconial component and anchoring proteins. There is ectopic debris formation in the ampulla under estrogen deficiency due to aberrant matrix protein expression. Furthermore, phytoestrogen is effective in rescuing the otoconia abnormalities. By comparing the expression levels of known estrogen receptor (Esr) subtypes, and by examining the otoconia phenotypes of null mice for selected receptors, we postulate that Esr2 may be critical in mediating the effects of estrogen in otoconia maintenance.</td>

We compared the BMD and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D between the patients and controls, and also compared the BMD between recurrent and non-recurrent BPPV groups. Among the female subjects, the BPPV group showed a significantly decreased BMD compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The men in the control group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than the men with BPPV (p < 0.05). Sixty-three patients (48%) reported recurrent attacks of BPPV. The women with recurrent BPPV were significantly older and showed a significantly lower BMD than non-recurrent women (p < 0.001). However, multiple regression analysis revealed that age alone was significantly associated with the recurrence of BPPV in women. BMD in women and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in men are associated with the occurrence of BPPV. Only age is an independent predictor of recurrence, though a low BMD and age correlate with the recurrence of BPPV.</td>

The purpose of this article was to provide direct data showing the distinct relationship between female sex hormone fluctuations and BPPV in postmenopausal female patients. Prospective analysis in humans and basic research in animals. Blood samples were analyzed to determine the levels of estradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in 50- to 80-year-old postmenopausal female patients newly diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV based on history compatible with BPPV and positive provocative maneuvers. Animal models of bilateral ovariectomy and female sex hormone replacement therapy were used to further confirm the relationship between BPPV and female sex hormone levels by determining the expression levels of otoconin 90, the protein suggested as essential in the dislocation of otoconia. Statistically significant differences between the estradiol level of BPPV patients and the control group were found (P < .001). Moreover, in bilateral ovariectomy in rats, 17β-estradiol replacement reversed the decrease of otoconin 90 levels. Our results suggest that estradiol deficiency may be an important risk factor for idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in postmenopausal female patients. NA.

	<td>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vertebral artery (VA) flow rates and diameters by using Doppler ultrasonography in patients with BPPV. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the abnormalities of VA values obtained by extracranial color-coded duplex sonography in BPPV, which could be accepted as a precursor lesion for posterior cerebral ischemic stroke. Between September 2017 to February 2018, 50 patients diagnosed with BPPV were enrolled in this study. Otorhinolaryngology medical examination and medical history assessment were performed at the otorhinolaryngology clinic. Afterward, neurologic examination and ultrasonography of VAs was undertaken in the neurology clinic of University of Gaziantep Medical Faculty. The types of BPPV found were as follows: right posterior in 27 (54%), right lateral in 4 (8%), left posterior in 16 (32%), and left lateral in 3 (6%), respectively. The most common variables found in the BPPV were smoking (26%), hypertension (26%), and hyperlipidemia (22%). VA flow rates and diameters were found to be affected at the site of BPPV. These findings might suggest that BPPV could be related to an atherosclerotic milieu and may be a precursor clinical condition for future intracranial atherosclerotic diseases.</td>

	<td>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of peripheral-type vertigo in the elderly. While some studies have investigated BPPV among the elderly, no study has focused on the isolated idiopathic BPPV (iBPPV) in the elderly. To investigate the clinical features and recurrence rate in elderly patients diagnosed with iBPPV. The authors prospectively reviewed the medical records of 627 patients diagnosed with BPPV, and a total of 370 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The subjects were divided into two groups by age (experimental group ≥65 years and control group 17-64 years), and the gender, numbers of canalith reposition maneuver (CRM) for successful treatment, time elapsed from onset of symptoms to clinic visit, the affected semicircular canal, and the 1- and 5-year recurrence proportion were analyzed. The gender, numbers of CRM for successful treatment, affected semicircular canal, and the 1- and 5-year recurrence proportion showed no statistically significant difference between two groups (p > 0.05). The only exception was the experimental group which took a longer duration from manifestation of symptoms to hospital visit than control group (student's t test, p = 0.021). Several previous studies report that the elderly with iBPPV shows more protracted clinical course and much higher recurrence rate than younger adult. Unlike those reports, our study showed no significant differences about the clinical features and recurrence rate between age groups. The elderly with iBPPV could be treated as effective as general population.</td>

	<td>To define the risk factors and adverse effects associated with repeated canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). A case series featuring chart review. An academic university hospital. We retrospectively reviewed 1900 patients (average age, 54.9 years; range, 11-88 years) diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). All underwent repeated CRPs. We recorded clinical features including age, gender, BPPV cause (idiopathic or secondary), symptom duration, the canal involved, the number of sessions of CRP, recurrence, follow-up duration, and complications. We compared these factors using Pearson's chi-squared test and multiple linear regression analysis with dummy variables. BPPV was diagnosed based on the results of the head roll and Dix-Hallpike tests. The overall BPPV resolution rate for patients treated with repeated CRPs was 96.4%. The risk factors for the need for multiple CRPs in BPPV were the duration of vertigo before treatment (β = 0.326, p < 0.001), the type of canal involved (β = 0.130, p < 0.001), and age (β = 0.040, p = 0.040). The explanatory power of the regression model attained 46.0% (F = 172.510, p < 0.001). The failure rate of repeated CRPs was 3.6% and complications included canal conversion (3.1%), nausea (46.4%), vomiting (4.9%), head heaviness (50.8%), imbalance (31.9%), and hypotension or palpitations (8.6%). However, almost all patients recovered. The risk factors associated with the need for Multiple CRPs were as follows: longer duration of vertigo before treatment, bilateral or multiple canal involved, and age >50 years.</td>

	<td>Vertigo is defined as an abnormal sensation of body motion or of its surrounding objects. It is a common chief complaint in emergency departments comprising 2 to 3% of these consultations worldwide. Vertigo is classified as peripheral or central, according to its origin, and can also be occasionally mixed, the most common cause of peripheral involvement being benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The initial findings on clinical evaluation of patients are the clues for making a correct diagnosis. The differentiation between central and peripheral vertigo can be optimized by analysing nystagmus, by using the skew test and the head impulse test (HINTS), as also by performing the appropriate tests to evaluate the integrity of the vestibular-cerebellar pathway. In addition, tonal threshold audiometry could raise the diagnostic sensibility from 71 to 89% on initial approach. Appropriate diagnosis is the principal key for managing this clinical condition.</td>

	<td>Disorders of the inner-ear balance organs can be grouped by their manner of presentation into acute, episodic, or chronic vestibular syndromes. A sudden unilateral vestibular injury produces severe vertigo, nausea, and imbalance lasting days, known as the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). A bedside head impulse and oculomotor examination helps separate vestibular neuritis, the more common and innocuous cause of AVS, from stroke. Benign positional vertigo, a common cause of episodic positional vertigo, occurs when otoconia overlying the otolith membrane falls into the semicircular canals, producing brief spells of spinning vertigo triggered by head movement. Benign positional vertigo is diagnosed by a positional test, which triggers paroxysmal positional nystagmus in the plane of the affected semicircular canal. Episodic spontaneous vertigo caused by vestibular migraine and Ménière's disease can sometimes prove hard to separate. Typically, Ménière's disease is associated with spinning vertigo lasting hours, aural fullness, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss while VM can produce spinning, rocking, or tilting sensations and light-headedness lasting minutes to days, sometimes but not always associated with migraine headaches or photophobia. Injury to both vestibular end-organs results in ataxia and oscillopsia rather than vertigo. Head impulse testing, dynamic visual acuity, and matted Romberg tests are abnormal while conventional neurologic assessments are normal. A defect in the bony roof overlying the superior semicircular canal produces vertigo and oscillopsia provoked by loud sound and pressure (when coughing or sneezing). Three-dimensional temporal bone computed tomography scan and vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing help confirm the diagnosis of superior canal dehiscence. Collectively, these clinical syndromes account for a large proportion of dizzy and unbalanced patients.</td>

	<td>Patients with positional vertigo who have a positive Dix-Hallpike (DH) test are diagnosed as having definite benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and those who have a negative DH test as having probable BPPV. Little is known about the course of the disease in the latter group. The aim of the present study was to assess how many patients with probable BPPV convert into having a positive DH test during follow-up. We included new patients who had experienced typical positional vertigo within the past 4 weeks and had a negative DH test. Patients were followed up over a period of 8 weeks. If the symptoms re-occurred, they were invited to return to the clinic for diagnostic DH test and, if positive, treated with a canalith repositioning maneuver. During the inclusion period of 18 months, 167 patients had probable BPPV, in which 43 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 57 (SD 14.5) years. Of the patients, 27 (63%) were females. During follow-up, 25 (58%) patients suffered from recurring positional vertigo, in which 13 underwent the DH test. Of the 13 patients, 8 were positive in 7 (16%) patients; 1 patient had a positive DH test twice. Among patients with a history of BPPV but a negative DH test at the first consultation, more than half (58%) experienced positional vertigo within 8 weeks. In 1 of 6 patients, the diagnosis was changed from probable to definite BPPV. Our advice to professionals who are confronted with a patient with symptoms of BPPV, but with a negative DH test, is to adopt a policy of low-threshold access for patients with recurring symptoms.</td>

	<td>Acute vestibular disorder is a frequent cause of urgent hospitalization in elderly patients. A CNS vascular disorder is often thought to be a cause of vertigo and a patient is diagnosed with stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA) or vertebral-basilar insufficiency. Despite the higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in the elderly, stroke and TIA are not the only cause of acute vestibular disorder. Hyperdiagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases in patients with acute vertigo often leads to underdiagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders that could be successfully treated if timely diagnosed. The differential diagnosis of the lesions of central and peripheral vestibular systems is based on clinical examination of patients with acute vertigo including an analysis of cerebrovascular risk factors, characteristics of vertigo, nystagmus and careful identification of focal neurological symptoms.</td>

	<td>Balance assessment relies on symptoms, clinical examination and functional assessment and their verification in objective tests. Our study was aimed at calculating the assessment compatibility between questionnaires, functional scales and objective vestibular and balance examinations. A group of 131 patients (including 101 women; mean age: 59±14 years) of the audiology outpatient clinic was examined. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, phobic vertigo and central dizziness were the most common diseases observed in the study group. Patients' symptoms were tested using the questionnaire on Cawthworne-Cooksey exercises (CC), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Duke Anxiety-Depression Scale. Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Tinetti test, Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) were used for the functional balance assessment. Objective evaluation included: videonystagmography caloric test and static posturography. The study results revealed statistically significant but moderate compatibility between functional tests BBS, DGI, TUG, DVA and caloric results (Kendall's W = 0.29) and higher for posturography (W = 0.33). The agreement between questionnaires and objective tests were very low (W = 0.08-0.11).The positive predictive values of BBS were 42% for caloric and 62% for posturography tests, of DGI - 46% and 57%, respectively. The results of functional tests (BBS, DGI, TUG, DVA) revealed statistically significant correlations with objective balance tests but low predictive values did not allow to use these tests in vestibular damage screening. Only half of the patients with functional disturbances revealed abnormal caloric or posturography tests. The qualification to work based on objective tests ignore functional state of the worker, which may influence the ability to work. Med Pr 2018;69(2):179-189.</td>

The age，gender and history course of the two groups were analyzed respectively. ①Among the 1 257 cases of BPPV, 336 (111 male and 225 female) were diagnosed as BPPV-spontaneously cured, with total self remission rate of 26.7%. And the female self remission rate is lower than men slightly（25.9% vs 28.5%）.②The ratio of male to female was 1∶2 in patients with BPPV-spontaneously cured and 1∶2.3 in patients with BPPV. Patients of the two groups were mostly female, and there was no significant difference in gender distribution. ③There was no significant difference in age distribution between patients of BPPV-spontaneously cured and BPPV, and patients of ＞50-70 years old were common in both groups.④The history course of patients in BPPV-spontaneously cured and BPPV both were mostly within 2 weeks at their first visit to hospital,each accounting for 75.3% and 69.3%.But the ratio of patients with BPPV-spontaneously cured for 1-2 weeks was higher than that of the BPPV (20.5% vs 15.1%), and the difference was statistically significant. Whether patients with BPPV can cure spontaneously is not related to age or gender, while women may have a tendency of lower self remission rate. The natural course of patients with BPPV-spontaneously cured is mostly within 2-4 weeks. The duration of natural course may be related to the type of semicircular canal involved.</td>

	<td>The objective of this article is to study the characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and the influencing factors of residual symptoms after otolith repositioning therapy, so as to provide references for clinical diagnosis and treatment. From June to November in 2017，568 patients with BPPV were diagnosed and treated in otolaryngology out-patient clinics. All of these patients were followed up after 1 month, and we summarized the amount of residual symptoms.The age,sex,type of disease, etiological factor and the condition of internal medicine were compared between residual symptom ones and no residual symptom ones. All data were statistically analyzed by SPPS 22.0 software.  The age range was 12-92 years, and the average age of onset was (54.89±13.06) years. The proportion of men and women was 1.00∶2.74, and the number of middle aged and elderly women at the age of 45-65 was the highest, up to 74.4%. The posterior semicircular canal accounted for about 55.6%, the horizontal semicircular canal accounted for about 22.6%, and the two kinds of semicircular canals were involved in about 21.8%. Primary BPPV accounted for about 90.67% and secondary BPPV accounted for about 9.33%. Secondary BPPV patients had more trauma and middle ear surgery. After reposition, there were 98 remnants of dizziness and balance disorder. There was no significant difference of residual symptoms ( >0.05) between the different sex,the cause and the incidence of the disease. Whether more than 65 years old, whether or not accumulative semicircular canals,whether the combination of related internal medical diseases were compared ( <0.05), and the difference was statistically significant. The residual symptoms such as dizziness and balance disorder were easy to occur after otolith reduction in patients with older, multisemiconventional tube and associated internal medical diseases. Correct guidance and education should be carried out for the patients, and the training of the vestibule rehabilitation should be instructed.</td>

The latency of liberation was(2.30±1.41) s and the duration was(11.84±5.98) s. In seconds, the slow phase phasic velocity of the nystagmus was(7.80±4.57)°/s; there was no statistical difference in latency between the detached nystagmus and the Hallpike nystagmus( >0.05), while there was a statistically significant difference between the duration and the nystagmus intensity( <0.01). For PC-BPPV restoration, the presence or absence of nystagmus can be used as a reference to judge whether the restoration succeed or not.The latency of nystagmus at the Hallpike position may be related to the stalactite precipitation rate. The duration and the slow phase angle velocity of the upper hop eye may be related to the otolith quantity.</td>

According to the type of BPPV, patients were treated with the appropriate repositioning maneuver, and the clinical efficacy of repositioning maneuver was analyzed and summarized.   Nine hundred and seven patients of BPPV with typical nystagmus were elected in this study. 585 out of 907 were female and 322 out of were male, and the mean age was 53.10±14.25(13 to 89) years. The lesion located to the posterior semiCIrcular canal was 489 patients(53.9%), horizontal semiCIrcular canal was 312 patients(34.4%), anterior semiCIrcular was 63 patients(6.9%), and multiple semiCIrcular was 43 patients(4.8%). According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis curve, the median cure time for the modified Semont and Epley repositioning maneuver in PC-BPPV groups was 3 days, and there was no significant difference in survival curves between the two repositioning maneuver. Meanwhile, the median cure time for Barbecue and Li horizontal canal quick repositioning maneuver groups was 3 days, and 1 day for Gufoni repositioning maneuver group in HC-BPPV groups. And there was no significant difference in survival curves among the three repositioning maneuver. In the AC-BPPV, 7 cases, 31 cases, 57 cases, 58 cases were cured with the Li anterior canal quick repositioning maneuver in the 1st day, the 3rd day, 1 week later, and 1 month later, and 5 cases lost to be follow-up. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis curve, the median cure time for the Li anterior canal quick repositioning maneuver in AC-BPPV groups was 3 days.  Repositioning maneuver represents a simple, safe, rapid and effective approach to the treatment of BPPV. Therefore, repositioning maneuver should be choice for the BPPV treatment.</td>

All patients were in regular treatment. Besides, according to the types of BPPV, patients do the Epley maneuver or Barbecue roll maneuver. We summarized the result and treatment of the patients.  The audiometric curve of ISSHL with vertigo were mainly at flat type. After treatment of the ISSHL patients were better than the patients with vertigo in the degrees of hearing loss . Furthermore, the rate of the patients of marked efficiency, efficiency and total efficiency of ISSHL was lower than the ones without.The patients with BPPV, including 12 cases of posterior semicircular canal and the 3 cases of lateral semicircular canal, were all ipsilateral.  ISSHL with vertigo group lost hearing is severer than ISSHL without vertigo. Thus the hearing and the treatment effect were worse.The symptoms without vertigo in ISSHL were better than the patients with vertigo.</td>

In this study, we attempted to determine valid clinical tests that can differentiate older individuals who are at risk of falling. Older adults from an independent-living community volunteered to participate in this descriptive, cohort study. They were administered the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Zur Balance Scale (ZBS), Head Shaking Nystagmus Head Impulse Test, Dynamic Visual Acuity, and the Hallpike maneuver for evaluating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV); a questionnaire including sociodemographics and a health characteristics survey. Multivariate analysis indicated that a ZBS score < 51, previous fall, and number of medications strongly predict falls in older adults. ZBS score, BBS score, Hallpike maneuver, number of medications, deficit of vestibular ocular reflex, along with positive ZBS score and past fall differentiate between fallers and non-fallers. ZBS <51, taking >6 medications, and history of falls were a benchmark for high-risk of falling.</td>

	<td>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between age, gender and affected ear, in patients presenting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. This was a retrospective study. Data from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo clinical reports (January 2009-December 2014) were analysed. A total of 174 patients affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior semicircular canal have been identified. Pearson chi-square test has been used to evaluate the probability of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo occurrence in relation to gender and side, within the studied groups. The level of significance was set at a p < 0.05. Considering age as a discriminant factor, three groups of patients were identified: group 1: 16 patients with an age <40 years; group 2: 79 patients with an age between 40 and 65 years and group 3: 79 patients with an age >65 years. In each group, the right posterior semicircular canal was involved in the majority of cases (group 1 incidence: 12/16; group 2 incidence: 49/79 and group 3 incidence: 52/79). In all three groups, female patients were significantly more affected (9/16 in group 1, 61/79 in group 2 and 55/79 in group 3). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is most prevalent in female subjects having an age>40 years and mainly involves the right posterior semicircular canal.</td>

	<td>Rehabilitation for persons with vertigo and balance disorders is becoming commonplace and the literature is expanding rapidly. The present review highlights recent findings of both peripheral and central vestibular disorders and provides insight into evidence related to new rehabilitative interventions. Risk factors will be reviewed to create a better understanding of patient and clinical characteristics that may effect recovery among persons with vestibular disorders. Clinical practice guidelines have recently been developed for peripheral vestibular hypofunction and updated for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Diagnoses such as persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) and vestibular migraine are now defined, and there is growing literature supporting the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation as a treatment option. As technology advances, virtual reality and other technologies are being used more frequently to augment vestibular rehabilitation. Clinicians now have a better understanding of rehabilitation expectations and whom to refer based on evidence in order to improve functional outcomes for persons living with peripheral and central vestibular disorders. An up-to-date understanding of the evidence related to vestibular rehabilitation can assist the practicing clinician in making better clinical decisions for their patient and hopefully result in optimal functional recovery.</td>

Herein, we aimed to determine the relationship between pre-treatment and post-treatment anxiety levels, assessed with Beck anxiety inventory, with educational status among patients diagnosed with and treated for Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and to evaluate the effect of treatment on the sub-parameters of the Beck anxiety inventory. Our study included a total of 33 patients that presented to the otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinic with acute vertigo and were diagnosed to have posterior canal BPPV. Patients diagnosed with posterior BPPV were applied Beck anxiety inventory prior to the treatment as well as 1 week and 4 weeks after the treatment. Compared to the control group, statistically significant changes were observed in relation to pre-treatment and post-treatment inventory scores (p < 0.05). A comparison of the pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments revealed significant differences (p < 0.05). Improvements were observed in 48% (10/21) of the subparameters by the end of the first week at the earliest. Educational status had no significant effect on inventory scores (p > 0.05). Anxiety-related subjective symptoms mostly started to improve 1 week after the treatment at the earliest, and symptoms showed persistence at a certain level even at the end of the first month. Inequalities between the patients' educational levels affect anxiety levels. It should be remembered that educational status should be considered when approaching patients.</td>

	<td>Dizziness is a common complaint in medicine. Nevertheless, there is a lack of valid data concerning the age and gender distribution of dizziness disorders within a larger population. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to undertake a representative epidemiological survey that examines all age groups of an entire population and describes the age and gender distribution of the most common peripheral vestibular disorders. A population-based epidemiological survey based on confirmed ICD-10 codes, of an entire national population was performed. The population-based data of 70,315,919 patients were leveraged, as provided by 123 statutory health insurance companies in Germany. Patients of all age groups were analyzed. Outcome measures were age and gender distribution and the prevalence of unspecific vertigo, Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and other peripheral vestibular disorders. The prevalence among the recorded diagnoses was 6.5% (6,461/100,000 individuals), with women (N = 2,973,323; 65.4%) being significantly more frequently affected by vertigo than men (N = 1,570,240; 34.6%; p < 0.001). Vertigo is rare in childhood (i.e., up to 10-14 yr of age). Subsequently, the prevalence of the analyzed diseases increases with age, up to a peak between 74 and 94 years. The results demonstrate that peripheral vestibular disorders are common in a developed country, across all age groups and a specific distribution of these disorders can be identified for every age group and gender. The impact of these disorders on the German healthcare system is currently underestimated.</td>

	<td>Rehabilitation for individuals after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion requires emphasis on both cognitive and physical rest, with a gradual return to activity including sports. As the client becomes more active, the rehabilitation professional should pay close attention to symptoms associated with mTBI, such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The systematic approach to return to play provided by the Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport can apply to adults with mTBI. This protocol calls for gradually increasing the intensity of physical activity while attending to postconcussion symptoms. During the incident that led to an mTBI, the injured individual may incur injuries to the vestibular and balance system that are best addressed by professionals with specific training in vestibular rehabilitation, most commonly physical therapists. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a condition in which otoconia particles in the inner ear dislodge into the semicircular canals, resulting in severe vertigo and imbalance. This condition frequently resolves in a few sessions with a vestibular physical therapist. In conditions such as gaze instability, motion sensitivity, impaired postural control, and cervicogenic dizziness, improvement is more gradual and requires longer follow-up with a physical therapist and a home exercise program. In all of the above-stated conditions, it is essential to consider that a patient with protracted symptoms of mTBI or postconcussion syndrome will recover more slowly than others and should be monitored for symptoms throughout the intervention.</td>

	<td>Patients with migraine often experience various types of vertigo, and several studies have suggested an epidemiologic and physiologic association of migraine and vertigo with vestibule. However, few researchers have investigated the association between migraine and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). To determine the incidence of BPPV in individuals with migraine in a large national population-based sample. This cohort study obtained data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service covering the period January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2013. These data included personal information, health insurance claim codes, diagnostic codes, death records, socioeconomic data, and medical examination data for each individual in the database. A 1:4 matching method was used to select individuals for the migraine group (n = 40 682) and the control group (n = 162 728). Individuals who had a history of BPPV before the index date, for whom a match could not be identified, and who received a migraine diagnosis before age 20 years were excluded from the analysis. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. The crude and adjusted (by age, sex, income, region of residence, and medical history [hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia]) hazard ratios for migraine and BPPV were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Of the 40 682 individuals in the migraine group, 10 381 (25.5%) were male and 30 301 (74.5%) were female. Of the 162 728 controls, 41 524 (25.5%) were male and 121 204 (74.5%) were female. The incidence of BPPV was statistically significantly higher in the migraine group than in the control group (2431 [6.0%] vs 3677 [2.3%]). Migraine increased the risk of BPPV (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.41-2.68). In a subgroup analysis, the incidence of BPPV in all age groups and in both men and women was statistically significantly higher in the migraine group than in the control group. The incidence of BPPV was the highest in men younger than 40 years (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.49; 95% CI, 3.05-6.62), and the HR decreased in both men and women as age increased. Migraine appeared to be statistically significantly associated with higher incidence of BPPV; future studies are needed to determine the association between BPPV and specific factors related to migraine.</td>

SSNHL was classified based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) code H91.2. We included only participants who received an audiometry examination and steroid treatment. After exclusion of participants diagnosed with Menière's disease (H81.0), we extracted data for SSNHL patients (n = 4,109) and 1:4-matched controls (n = 16,436). Matching was performed based on age, sex, income, region of residence, and medical history. BPPV was diagnosed with the ICD-10 code H81.1. Among them, we only included the participants who visit more than or equal to two times for BPPV that does not mean recurrent BPPV. The crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models, and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to age and sex. The rate of BPPV in the SSNHL group (3.8% [157/4,109]) was higher than that in the control group (1.9% [220/16,436], p < 0.001). The adjusted HR of BPPV was 2.90 (95% CI = 2.36-3.56, p < 0.05). After experiencing SSNHL, the rate of BPPV in the SSNHL group was significantly higher for patients with two, three to four, and more than or equal to five visits for BPPV. In the subgroup analyses, a significant association between SSNHL and BPPV was observed regardless of age and sex. The risk of BPPV is greater in patients with SSNHL.</td>

	<td>Evidence on the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre in primary care is scarce. To evaluate effectiveness at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year of a single Epley manoeuvre versus a sham manoeuvre in primary care. Multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trial in two primary care practices in Spain from November 2012 to January 2015. Patients were ≥18 years diagnosed with subjective or objective posterior benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (vertigo only, or vertigo and nystagmus after a Dix-Hallpike test [DHT]). The intervention group received the Epley manoeuvre, and the control group received a sham manoeuvre. Betahistine was prescribed following the same regimen in both groups. The main outcome measures were the DHT result classified as negative (neither vertigo nor nystagmus) or positive. Positive results were further divided into a positive result for both vertigo and nystagmus (positive DHT with nystagmus), and a positive result for vertigo only (positive DHT without nystagmus); self-reported resolution of vertigo; and self-reported severity of vertigo evaluated on a 10-point Likert scale (10 = worst imaginable vertigo). In total, 134 patients were randomised to either the intervention group (  = 66) or the sham group (  = 68). The intervention group showed better results in the unadjusted analyses at 1 week, with a lower rate of positive DHT with nystagmus (  = 0.022). A positive baseline DHT with nystagmus was associated with a reduction in vertigo severity (marginal effect for 10-point Likert-like question -1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.95 to -0.51) and better positive DHT rates in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.92) in the multivariate analyses. A single Epley manoeuvre performed in primary care is an effective treatment for reversing a positive DHT and reducing vertigo severity in patients with baseline nystagmus in the DHT.</td>

	<td>In the present study, the value of cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) as a predictive factor for residual dizziness after recovery of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was evaluated. The present study included 65 patients who had BPPV and underwent cVEMP testing. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the presence or absence of residual dizziness after recovery of BPPV. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with residual dizziness using age, gender, affected semicircular canal, affected side, BPPV duration, and cVEMP parameters. In univariate analysis, cVEMP-modified interaural amplitude difference (IAD) ratio and p13 latency showed a relatively significant association (p < 0.20) with residual dizziness. Based on multivariate analysis, increased cVEMP-modified interaural amplitude difference (IAD) ratio at the affected side (≥25%; p = 0.018, OR 6.623) remained as an associated factor. Increased cVEMP-modified IAD ratio at the affected side is associated with residual dizziness. BPPV patients with increased cVEMP-modified IAD ratio at the affected side are more likely to have residual dizziness after recovery of BPPV. cVEMP testing could be used for the prediction of residual dizziness. An increased cVEMP-modified IAD ratio at the affected side may be used as a predictor of residual dizziness.</td>

	<td>To determine the typical proportions of diagnoses for patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo based on clinical speciality and to assess the change in proportions of diagnoses over time. Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches of PubMed and CINAHL databases and follow-up reference searches were performed for articles published in English up to October 2016. Analysis of searches yielded 42 studies meeting the criteria of case series of adult patients with dizziness and/or vertigo presenting to general practice, emergency departments or specialist outpatient clinics. Data comprising demographics, diagnostic cases, and the total number of cases were recorded and independently tested, followed by a risk of bias analysis. Sample size weighted proportions expressed as percentages with confidence intervals were calculated and compared using χ analysis and a reference proportion formed by the combination of Ear Nose and Throat and Neurotology case series published between 2010 and 2016. Analysis of diagnostic trends over time used Poisson regression with consideration for overdispersion. This systematic review of case series demonstrated significant differences in the proportions of diagnoses for patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo, depending on the specialty making the diagnosis. ENT proportions were dominated by BPPV, Psychogenic and Menière's disease diagnostic categories, whereas emergency proportions were dominated by Other, Cardiac, and Neurological categories. Analysis of case series proportions over time revealed increases in diagnoses such as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and Vestibular Migraine, and a corresponding decrease in the diagnoses of Menière's disease.</td>

	<td>Each year, the United States spends over $4 billion on emergency department visits for evaluation of dizziness. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of dizziness that can easily be diagnosed by observing characteristic eye movements during the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT). The DHT is easily performed; however, interpretation requires more advanced training. This may be part of the reason it is not commonly performed in emergency departments, and instead, patients undergo costly imaging tests. We evaluated whether smartphone-based video recordings of DHT could be assessed telemedically for screening of nonacute dizziness. Feasibility study. Dizzy patients underwent objective vestibular testing, but also had videos of their eye movements recorded via a smartphone during the DHT. The videos were remotely reviewed by two neuro-otologists for BPPV screening and were compared to objective and in-person exam findings. Overall, 30 dizzy patients were evaluated with seven cases of BPPV. The sensitivity for diagnosing BPPV via a smartphone-recording of eye movements of the DHT was 92.86%, with a specificity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 97.87%. Our initial proof-of-concept study shows that remote screening of BPPV is possible with high specificity. Because the DHT is easily taught, having a remote otolaryngologist interpret the resulting eye movements may increase usage of the test and may lead to cost savings. 4 Laryngoscope, 129:466-469, 2019.</td>

	<td>To provide an update on the most frequent peripheral vestibular disorders. The on-going classification of vestibular disorders by the Bárány Society represents major progress. The diagnosis of bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) requires quantitative testing of vestibular function. 'Acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy' (AUPVP) is now preferred over 'vestibular neuritis.' Menière's disease is a set of disorders with a significant genetic contribution. The apogeotropic variant of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (hcBPPV) and anterior canal BPPV (acBPPV) can be distinguished from a central vestibular lesion. Vestibular paroxysmia is now an internationally accepted clinical entity. The diagnosis of SCDS is based on conclusive findings. Diagnosis of BVP requires significantly reduced vestibular function. The clinical picture of AUPVP depends on how much the vestibular end organs or their innervation are affected. Menière's disease phenotype is a constellation of symptoms. Although diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for pc and hcBPPV are well defined, a number of less frequent and controversial are increasingly diagnosed and can be treated. Diagnosis of vestibular paroxysmia requires that a patient responds to treatment with a sodium channel blocker. The diagnosis of SCDS requires conclusive findings with various methods. There is still a great need for state-of-the-art randomized controlled treatment trials in most peripheral vestibular disorders.</td>

	<td>In patients with chronic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), i.e., chronic vestibular multicanalicular canalithiasis (CVMCC), abnormal signals are transmitted from diseased labyrinths via the healthy vestibular nuclei complex to their end organs. The vestibulo-thalamo-cortical reflex as proposed in vestibular migraine is just one of these reflexes. In a group of patients diagnosed with CVMCC otolith repositioning maneuvers specific for each semicircular canal (SCC) ameliorated pain and other symptoms in 90%. Increased awareness of CVMCC may reduce suffering and continuous medication. To evaluate if CVMCC can be the trigger of symptoms in vestibular migraine, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and whiplash associated disorders (WAD). Retrospective consecutive observational cohort study. Ambulatory at a private Otoneurology Centre. One hundred sixty-three patients with CVMCC and a history of trauma. Based on the symptoms (structured symptom questionnaire), the patients are post hoc sub grouped according to the criteria of the different diagnoses. Frequency of patients with CVMCC who fulfill the criteria of the different diagnoses. 98% of all patients with CVMCC fulfill the Barany Society criteria of a probable vestibular migraine; 17% fulfill the International Classification of Headache Disorders defined vestibular migraine criteria; 63% fulfill the Fukuda criteria of ME/CFS; 100% of the patients with WAD suffer from CVMCC. This survey supports the hypothesis that CVMCC can be the trigger of symptoms in vestibular migraine, ME/CFS, and WAD. The actual diagnosis the patient receives is often in accordance with the patient's dominant symptom.</td>

	<td>To describe the clinical features of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in children. A retrospective study. Six children diagnosed with BPPV between March 2014 and March 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. BPPV was diagnosed using the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll tests and treated with either the modified Epley particle repositioning procedure or Lempert or Gufoni manoeuvre. Follow-up was performed at 1-week intervals until vertigo and nystagmus disappeared during positional testing. A total of six children were followed up for a period of 10-22 months. Clinical features such as history, nystagmus and symptoms of vertigo, dizziness and nausea. Six children were diagnosed with BPPV using positional testing and treated with the modified Epley or Lempert/Gufoni particle repositioning procedures. Four children were diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV, while the remaining two were diagnosed with horizontal canal BPPV. One girl reported a history of head trauma, one girl had a family history of vertigo, and one boy reported hearing loss in the same ear as that affected by BPPV. Overall, 83.33% of children (5/6) were completely relieved of vertigo following one treatment session. The remaining child was asymptomatic after two sessions. No child reported relapse of vertigo during the follow-up period. BPPV can be diagnosed accurately by taking a detailed medical history and by use of positional testing. BPPV in children can be successfully identified and treated.</td>
